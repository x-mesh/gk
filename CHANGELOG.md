# Changelog

All notable changes to gk will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.29.1] - 2026-05-06

### Fixed

- **`gk commit` and other git-driven commands could fail with "Author identity
  unknown" inside containers and other minimal environments.** The internal
  `ExecRunner.buildCmd` was overwriting the child process environment with
  only the guard variables (`LC_ALL`, `LANG`, `GIT_OPTIONAL_LOCKS`,
  `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT`), dropping `HOME`, `USER`, `PATH`, and
  `SSH_AUTH_SOCK`. Without `HOME`, git could not locate `~/.gitconfig`, so
  on hosts where `hostname` is `(none)` (typical for unprivileged
  containers) git fell back to a synthetic identity like
  `user@host.(none)` and aborted the commit. The runner now layers
  `os.Environ()` first, then the guard variables, then any caller-supplied
  `ExtraEnv`, so guard semantics still win for duplicate keys while parent
  state is preserved.

## [0.29.0] - 2026-05-06

### Added

- **POSIX install script.** `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/x-mesh/gk/main/install.sh | sh`
  auto-detects OS and architecture, downloads the matching archive from the
  latest release, verifies the published `sha256`, and installs the binary
  to `/usr/local/bin` (falling back to `~/.local/bin` when the default is
  not writable). Pin a specific release with `GK_VERSION=v0.29.0` and
  override the install path with `GK_INSTALL_DIR=$HOME/.local/bin`.

### Changed

- **Stable archive URLs.** `.goreleaser.yaml` now produces archives named
  `gk_<os>_<arch>.tar.gz` instead of `gk_<version>_<os>_<arch>.tar.gz`, so
  `https://github.com/x-mesh/gk/releases/latest/download/gk_linux_amd64.tar.gz`
  resolves consistently across releases. Homebrew users see no change
  because goreleaser regenerates the formula from the same template, but
  scripts that hardcoded versioned download URLs need an update. The new
  `install.sh` relies on this naming, so `GK_VERSION` pins only work for
  v0.29.0 and later.
- **README prose pass.** Both `README.md` and `README.ko.md` were rewritten
  for naturalness (denser bullet headers, fewer em-dashes, less AI-toned
  vocabulary) and a misstatement about AI provider transport was corrected:
  `anthropic`, `openai`, `nvidia`, and `groq` call their respective APIs
  directly over HTTP, while `gemini`, `qwen`, and `kiro-cli` are driven as
  external CLI subprocesses.

## [0.28.0] - 2026-05-04

### Added

- **`gk status -v` divergence diagram** — when the current branch is
  ahead/behind its upstream, the rich-mode output now includes a
  small ASCII branch graph showing both rays meeting at the merge
  base. Up to six commits per side are drawn explicitly; counts
  beyond that collapse to a `…` ellipsis. The block is omitted when
  there is no upstream or both counts are zero (`↑0 ↓0` would render
  as two empty rays).

  ```
  ┌─ divergence ────────────────────────────┐
  │    o─o─o   ↑3 you                       │
  │   /                                     │
  │ ──●  merge-base 86d3aac                 │
  │   \                                     │
  │    o─o     ↓2 origin                    │
  └─────────────────────────────────────────┘
  ```

- **`gk status -v` 7-day activity heatmap** — a sparkline + day-of-
  week strip summarising commits over the last seven local days,
  scaled to the busiest day's count. Today is rightmost so the eye
  lands on "now" first; an empty range renders as flat `▁` cells
  with `0 commits`. Fetch-free (`git log` only) so the block adds
  no network cost.

  ```
  ┌─ activity 7d ───────────────────────────┐
  │ ▂ ▅ █ ▄ ▁ ▂ ▂   23 commits              │
  │ T W T F S S M                           │
  └─────────────────────────────────────────┘
  ```

### Internal

- New file `internal/cli/status_richblocks.go` with
  `renderDivergenceDiagram` (uses `git merge-base HEAD <upstream>`
  for the SHA label) and `renderActivityHeatmap` (uses `git log
  --since=7.days.ago --pretty=format:%cd --date=unix`).

## [0.27.0] - 2026-05-04

### Added

- **`gk status` rich density mode** — `gk status -v` (or
  `status.density: rich` in `.gk.yaml`) wraps the branch line and the
  working-tree body in square boxes (`┌─ branch ─┐` / `┌─ working
  tree ─┐`) and appends a highlighted next-action strip with a
  one-line "why" beneath. The next-action selector covers the full
  steady-state matrix — conflicts, dirty + diverged, dirty + behind,
  dirty alone, ahead, behind, diverged, no-upstream, in-sync — and
  emits a single concrete command for each. Rich mode is opt-in: the
  default `gk status` output is unchanged, JSON output is unchanged,
  and `--json` always wins. Verbose-summary diagnostics that used to
  fire on `-v` are now gated behind `-vv` so the visual layer and the
  technical-detail layer stop fighting for the same screen.

### Changed

- **`gk status` always shows the last commit age + SHA**. The
  previous code suppressed the `· last commit Nm/Nh` tail when the
  HEAD commit was under 24 hours old on the assumption that "active
  branches commit multiple times per day, so it's noise". User
  feedback: status is the "current state at a glance" command — the
  exact case where the user just committed is the *most* relevant
  moment to see the SHA and freshness, not the least. The 24h gate
  is removed; `lastCommitAgo` now renders unconditionally.

### Internal

- New helper `internal/cli/status_box.go` (`renderBox`,
  `renderNextActionBlock`) plus `flushRichStatus` /
  `suggestNextAction` / `filterLegacyNextHints` /
  `stripANSIEscapes` in `status.go` for the rich-mode pipeline.
  `StatusConfig.Density` is the new mapstructure key.

## [0.26.0] - 2026-05-04

### Added

- **`gk do`, `gk explain`, `gk ask` — natural-language assist commands**
  built on the existing AI provider plumbing (`nvidia → gemini → qwen
  → kiro-cli`). `gk do "<intent>"` turns Korean/English natural
  language into a vetted git/gk command sequence, dry-runs by default,
  and gates dangerous ops (force push, hard reset, history rewrite)
  behind an extra confirmation prompt. `gk explain "<error>"` parses
  the error text, surfaces likely cause, recovery steps, and a
  prevention tip; `--last` repurposes the helper to walk the user
  through the previous command they ran. `gk ask "<question>"` answers
  git/gk concept questions with concrete examples drawn from the
  current repo state (real branch names, commit shas, file paths).
  Provider resolution mirrors `gk commit`: `--provider` flag → 
  `ai.provider` config → auto-detect. Lives under `internal/aichat/`
  with safety classifiers, repo-context collection, and full unit
  coverage; the CLI surface is `internal/cli/ai_{do,explain,ask}.go`.

### Changed

- **`internal/aichat` cleanup** — dropped two unused `dbg` helpers on
  `ErrorAnalyzer` / `QAEngine` and ran `gofmt -w` over the package so
  `golangci-lint run` is clean.

## [0.25.0] - 2026-05-03

### Changed

- **`gk pull` upstream resolution prefers same-name remote ref over the
  base branch**. When the current branch had no `@{u}` configured, gk
  previously fell straight back to the repo's base branch — so running
  `gk pull` on `develop` silently fetched `origin/main` and the user
  saw an unrelated ref being updated. Now gk first checks whether
  `<remote>/<currentBranch>` exists in the local ref cache; if so,
  that ref is used as the fetch target and stderr suggests
  `git branch --set-upstream-to=<remote>/<branch>`. When neither
  tracking nor a same-name cached ref is available, the fallback to
  the base branch is preserved but stderr now spells out exactly what
  is happening, including the `git fetch && git branch
  --set-upstream-to` command pair to recover.

### Fixed

- **`gk status` raw, locale-leaking error in non-git directory**.
  Running `gk status` outside a repository printed the literal
  porcelain command and git's translated stderr (e.g. `git status
  --porcelain=v2 -z --작업 갈래 (branch): exit code 128: fatal: not
  a git repository`). The error is now caught at the call site and
  rendered as `gk status: git 저장소가 아닙니다` with a hint to run
  `git init` or change directory. Detection lives in a shared
  `isNotAGitRepoError` helper (`internal/cli/errhint.go`) that walks
  the error chain plus `git.ExitError`'s stderr, so other commands
  can adopt the same friendly treatment without duplicating the
  string match.

## [0.24.2] - 2026-05-03

### Fixed

- **`gk commit` secret-gate misreports markdown headings as filenames**.
  When the staged payload included a markdown `### Foo` line (e.g. a
  `### 첫 호출` heading inside a README), the file-boundary parser
  treated it as a new file marker, so finding output rendered as
  `[builtin] generic-secret @ 첫 호출:21 — toke***` instead of
  pointing at the actual source path. The aggregated payload now
  uses a `>>> gk-file <path> <<<` sentinel that cannot collide with
  H3 headings (`internal/secrets.PayloadFileHeader`), and
  `renderFindings` falls back to `(unknown file, payload line N)` if
  the header parser fails. Same sentinel is shared by `gk push`'s
  `scanDiffAdditions` for consistent reporting.

## [0.24.0] - 2026-04-30

### Removed

- **Korean subcommand aliases** (`gk 상태` / `gk 저장` / `gk 갈래` / …).
  Registration ran inside `PersistentPreRunE`, but cobra resolves the
  subcommand name *before* PreRun fires, so the aliases never reached
  the dispatch table — they appeared in docs but always failed with
  `unknown command "상태"`. Dropping the dead code (`internal/easy/
  alias.go` + tests + the `easy.RegisterAliases` call). Easy Mode
  itself is unaffected; only the never-functional alias surface is
  gone.

### Added

- **More Korean Easy Mode hints in `gk status`** — when the working
  tree is otherwise clean, the status footer now surfaces a contextual
  next-step hint based on upstream divergence: `✨ 작업 폴더가
  깨끗합니다` (in sync), `📤 서버에 올릴 커밋이 N개 있습니다 → gk
  push` (ahead), `📥 서버에 새 커밋이 N개 있습니다 → gk pull`
  (behind), `🔀 양쪽에 새 커밋 있음 → gk sync` (diverged). Driven
  off the same `output.hints` knob (`verbose` / `minimal` / `off`).

## [0.23.0] - 2026-04-30

### Added

- **Easy Mode** — opt-in beginner-friendly output layer. Translates a
  curated set of git terminology to Korean equivalents wrapped with the
  English original in parens (`commit` → `변경사항 저장 (commit)`),
  prefixes status sections with emoji (`📋` / `❌` / `💡` / etc.), and
  appends contextual next-step hints from a fallback-chained i18n
  catalog. Off by default. Activation precedence: `--no-easy` flag >
  `--easy` flag > `output.easy` in config > `GK_EASY` env. Disabled
  paths short-circuit before any catalog or term-mapper construction
  so the cold-start cost is a single boolean check.
- **`gk guide [<workflow>]`** — standalone interactive walkthrough of
  common git workflows (init / first commit / push / merge conflict /
  undo). Renders steps with title, description, and run-able command
  in cyan. Independent of Easy Mode — works with any output config.
- **Korean command aliases under Easy Mode** — `gk 상태` / `gk 저장` /
  `gk 올리기` / `gk 가져오기` / `gk 동기화` / `gk 되돌리기` /
  `gk 갈래` / `gk 검사` / `gk 안내`. Registered via cobra's native
  `command.Aliases` field, so the entire subcommand tree (e.g.
  `gk 갈래 list`) resolves through to the original command without
  duplication. English-priority conflict guard refuses to register an
  alias that would shadow an existing English subcommand.
- **`internal/i18n` package** — message catalog with English and
  Korean tables, mode-aware lookup (`ModeEasy` / `ModeMinimal` /
  `ModeOff`), and a fallback chain (requested-lang → en → key
  passthrough). Format-string args propagate via `Getf`.
- **`output.*` config keys** — `output.easy` (bool, default false),
  `output.lang` (BCP-47 short code, default "ko"), `output.emoji`
  (bool, default true), `output.hints` (`verbose` | `minimal` | `off`,
  default `verbose`). Matching env shortcuts: `GK_EASY`, `GK_LANG`,
  `GK_EMOJI`, `GK_HINTS`.
- **`--easy` / `--no-easy` global flags** — per-invocation override
  of the config / env activation. `--no-easy` wins over `--easy` so
  scripts that hardcode disable can survive a globally-enabled config.

### Fixed

- **Easy Mode hint commands no longer get rewritten by term
  translation**. `status.go` and `errhint.go` previously ran
  `TranslateTerms` over already-translated catalog hints, so
  `→ gk commit` rendered as `→ gk 변경사항 저장 (commit)` —
  `\bcommit\b` matched the literal command token in the hint string,
  defeating the very suggestion the hint was supposed to surface.
  Hints now bypass `TranslateTerms`; only raw error text and
  unstructured git output flow through it.
- **`TermMapper.Translate` is idempotent**. The wrapping format
  `<translated> (<term>)` left `<term>` exposed to `\b<term>\b`
  on a second pass because `(` and `)` are non-word characters that
  count as word boundaries; double-applying the function nested the
  parentheticals (`(((commit)))…`). The replacement now uses
  position-aware substitution that skips matches surrounded by parens.
- **Korean aliases no longer reparent the English subcommand tree**.
  `RegisterAliases` previously built a fresh `*cobra.Command` per alias
  and called `aliasCmd.AddCommand(sub)` for every child of the
  original — cobra's `AddCommand` sets `sub.parent = aliasCmd`, which
  silently broke `CommandPath()` and completion for the original
  (running `gk branch list --help` would print the path as
  `gk 갈래 list`). Aliases are now appended to `original.Aliases`,
  the cobra-native pattern that keeps the subtree intact and is
  idempotent on re-registration.
- **Easy Mode error formatter wires emoji**. `errhint.go` previously
  built `ui.NewEasyFormatter(nil, ...)` twice inside a no-op
  conditional, so `FormatError` could never prefix the error / hint
  with `❌` / `💡` — Easy Mode's error output was missing the
  emoji it was advertising. New `Engine.Emoji()` accessor exposes
  the underlying mapper; the dead branch is gone.

### Internal

- **`RegisterAliases` idempotent on re-registration** — safe to call
  multiple times during tests or alternate cobra-tree boots.
- **Lint cleared** — gofmt (alias.go, hints_test.go), staticcheck
  SA5011 (alias_test.go added defensive `return` after `rapid.Fatalf`),
  errcheck (guide.go `bold.Fprintf` / `cyan.Fprintf` returns
  explicitly discarded with a comment documenting the
  best-effort-stdout-write contract).

## [0.22.0] - 2026-04-30

### Added

- **`gk diff`** — terminal-friendly diff viewer with color, line numbers,
  word-level highlights, and an optional interactive file picker
  (`-i`/`--interactive`). Honors `--staged`, `--stat`, `-U <n>`,
  `--no-pager`, `--no-word-diff`, and `--json`. Pager auto-invoked when
  output is a TTY; positional args (`<ref>`, `<ref>..<ref>`, `-- <path>`)
  pass through to `git diff`.
- **`gk diff` "no changes" banner** — when nothing matches the selected
  comparison, gk prints which trees were compared (`(working tree ↔
  index · 기본)`) and probes the *other* side: shows
  `staged 변경 N 파일 — gk diff --staged` when default-mode finds
  nothing but staging has work, or `unstaged 변경 있음 — gk diff` when
  `--staged` is empty but the working tree dirty. Universal alternates
  `gk diff HEAD` and `gk diff <ref>` always rendered.
- **`gk pull --rebase` / `--merge`** — shorthand for `--strategy rebase`
  / `--strategy merge`, and explicit consent for diverged-history pulls
  (see "Changed" below).
- **`gk pull --fetch-only`** — preferred name for fetch-without-integrate;
  `--no-rebase` retained as a deprecated alias.
- **`gk sync --fetch`** — opt-in one-shot: fetch `<remote>/<base>`,
  fast-forward `refs/heads/<base>`, then integrate. Combines the
  network-refresh and rebase-onto-base steps that previously required
  two commands.
- **Backup ref before history-rewriting integrations** — `gk pull
  --rebase` / `--merge` writes `refs/gk/backup/<branch>/<unix-ts>`
  pointing at the pre-integration tip and prunes entries older than
  30 days (preserving the newest 5). `git reset --hard <ref>` restores.
- **Inline conflict region preview in `gk pull` / `gk continue`** —
  paused integrations show the first conflict region with file line
  numbers, side markers (`◀` HEAD / `▶` incoming / `·` context), and
  a one-line summary of remaining regions. The same inline preview
  fires when `gk continue` is invoked while markers are still in the
  working tree.
- **`gk pull` early refusal on paused operations** — invoking `gk pull`
  while a rebase / merge / cherry-pick is in progress now refuses with
  the same banner instead of forwarding into the autostash path (where
  it produced an opaque "could not write index" error from git).
- **`gk resolve` TUI improvements** — line numbers, side labels with
  branch name / commit subject, region progress
  (`region 1/4 · lines 188–200`), and option labels with line counts
  (`ours — keep HEAD (5 lines)`,
  `theirs — accept cd98609 (subject) (5 lines)`). The legacy `-/+`
  diff formatter (`FormatHunkDiff`) stays as a fallback for callers
  without parsed regions.
- **Conflict-recovery banner surfaces `gk resolve`** — `gk pull`,
  `gk continue`, and the in-progress refusal banner now lead with
  `gk resolve` (AI-assisted) and `gk resolve --strategy ours|theirs`
  shortcuts before the manual edit recipe.
- **`gk sync` stale-base hint** — when `refs/heads/<base>` differs
  from `<remote>/<base>`, both `gk sync` and `gk status` surface
  `⚠ local main differs from origin/main (↑N local · ↓M origin)` with
  remediation hints (`git checkout main && gk pull` or
  `gk sync --fetch`).

### Changed

- **`gk sync` integrates against local `<base>` by default**. The
  v0.21 default was `<remote>/<base>` (silent fetch + integrate). Now
  sync is offline-by-default; the user's local base is the integration
  source. `gk sync --fetch` is the explicit one-shot opt-in.
  `--no-fetch` retained as a no-op alias for old scripts.
- **`gk pull` refuses to auto-rebase on diverged histories without
  explicit consent**. Previously the default strategy was `rebase`,
  which silently rewrote local SHAs when local commits hadn't been
  pushed yet. Now divergence triggers a refusal banner listing the
  at-risk local commits and the three resolution paths
  (`--rebase` / `--merge` / `--fetch-only`); explicit `--rebase` /
  `--merge` flags or `pull.strategy` config bypass the gate.
- **`Pull.Strategy` default value is empty** in `Defaults()`. The
  previous `"rebase"` default masked the resolver's `default` source
  signal that the new diverged-refusal logic relies on. The effective
  strategy when nothing is set remains `rebase`.

### Fixed

- **Submodule entries no longer leak into `gk commit` groupings**.
  `parsePorcelainV2` drops every `S<c><m><u>` sub-field record across
  ordinary, rename, and unmerged categories. Submodule pointer commits
  stay deliberate — the user must `git add <path>` them explicitly.
- **`gk pull` works when `@{u}` is set but `origin/HEAD` is not**.
  `runPullCore` now tries the branch's tracking ref first and only
  falls back to `DefaultBranch` detection when no upstream is
  configured. Previously a missing `origin/HEAD` (and no
  `develop`/`main`/`master`) failed with "could not determine default
  branch" even though `git rev-parse @{u}` would have answered.
- **CJK / multibyte labels no longer corrupt the conflict banner**.
  `renderConflictSide` truncated `displayLabel` via byte slicing
  (`displayLabel[:57]`), which split mid-codepoint for Korean /
  Japanese / Chinese / emoji branch names and emitted invalid UTF-8.
  Replaced with a rune-aware truncation; `headerRule` width also
  switched from `len()` to `utf8.RuneCountInString`.
- **AI strategy whitespace tolerated**. `buildResolveOptions` now
  trims `ai.Strategy` before lowering, so `"theirs "` / `" Theirs"`
  no longer silently miss the default-highlight check.
- **`gk sync --no-fetch --fetch` rejected as contradictory** instead
  of silently fetching. Three combinations now error:
  `--fetch-only + --fetch`, `--no-fetch + --fetch`,
  `--no-fetch + --fetch-only`.
- **`gk sync` integration count separates self-FF from base**. The
  summary's `+N commits` line previously absorbed the self-FF delta
  (commits picked up from `origin/<self>`) into the rebase-onto-base
  count. `preHEAD` is now captured after self-FF, and the count uses
  `pre..base` (commits brought in from base) so rebase no longer
  inflates it with rewritten local SHAs.

### Internal

- **`internal/diff` package** — unified-diff parser (round-trippable),
  renderer with word-diff, diffstat, JSON output. ~1700 lines impl +
  ~3600 lines tests (parse / render / format / stat / json / worddiff
  / property).
- **Word-diff LCS DP table bounded** — `wordDiffMaxLineBytes` (4 KB) +
  `wordDiffMaxCells` (1 M cells) prevent OOM on minified-bundle diffs
  that would otherwise allocate gigabytes. `buildSpans` switched from
  per-call `map[int]bool` to a two-pointer walk for zero-alloc span
  construction.
- **Diff scanner cap raised** to 64 MB (was 1 MB), absorbing realistic
  generated lockfiles / minified bundles without falling back to
  raw-byte output.

## [0.21.1] - 2026-04-30

### Fixed

- **릴리스 바이너리에 `-dirty` 마커가 박히던 문제**. v0.21.0이 태그 커밋에서
  깔끔하게 빌드됐는데도 `gk --version` 출력이 `commit <sha>-dirty`로 표시.
  - `.goreleaser.yaml`: `builds[].flags`에 `-buildvcs=false`, `-trimpath`
    추가. goreleaser의 `go mod tidy` before-hook이 빌드 샌드박스의 go.sum을
    일시적으로 변경해 `vcs.modified=true`가 BuildInfo에 임베드되던 경로 차단.
  - `cmd/gk/main.go`: `vcsFallback`이 ldflags로 채워진 commit에도 BuildInfo의
    `vcs.modified`를 보고 `-dirty`를 붙이던 가드 결함 수정.
    `vcsFallbackFromSettings`로 순수 함수 분리 + `fromVCS` bool 가드 추가 —
    `vcs.modified`는 같은 호출에서 `vcs.revision`으로 commit을 채운 경우에만
    적용.
  - 단위 테스트 6건 (`cmd/gk/main_test.go`)으로 v0.21.0 회귀 시나리오 + ldflags
    precedence + plain `go build`의 dirty 마킹을 모두 커버.

## [0.21.0] - 2026-04-30

### Added

- **`gk status` — base 출처 라벨**. `from <base>` 라인에 `default` /
  `configured` / `guessed` 라벨이 붙어 base 브랜치가 어디서 결정됐는지 한눈에
  보입니다. 내부 source 상수(`origin/HEAD`, `git config`, `.gk.yaml`,
  `GK_BASE_BRANCH`, `fallback`)는 그대로 유지되며, `-v` /
  `--explain-base`에서 기술 라벨로 노출됩니다.
- **`gk status --explain-base`** — base 결정 근거 다층 진단 블록. 모든 config
  layer + 캐시된 `origin/HEAD` + (옵션) live origin + 로컬 fallback 후보를
  나열하고 채택된 행에 ✓ 마커, 불일치 시 action hint를 표시합니다.
- **`gk status --explain-base --fetch-default`** — `git ls-remote --symref`
  한 번 호출로 라이브 origin/HEAD를 조회해 캐시본과 비교합니다.
  `SSH_ASKPASS=` / `GCM_INTERACTIVE=never`로 강화된 runner에서 실행돼 인증
  다이얼로그로 status가 멈추지 않습니다.
- **Base mismatch footer** — `cfg.BaseBranch`(.gk.yaml/git config/env)가
  캐시된 `origin/HEAD`와 다르면 `⚠ base 'X' (configured) ≠ origin default
  'Y'`와 `git remote set-head origin -a` 힌트가 출력됩니다.
- **Tracking mismatch footer** — `branch.<name>.merge`가 `refs/heads/Y`를
  가리키는데 로컬 이름이 `X`면 `⚠ tracking mismatch: local 'X' pushes to
  'origin/Y'` 경고와 `git branch --set-upstream-to=…` / `git push -u …` fix
  힌트, 그리고 per-branch 억제 방법을 함께 표시합니다.
- **`branch.<name>.gk-tracking-ok=true`** — triangular workflow / personal
  fork 등 트래킹 비대칭이 의도된 경우 per-branch로 tracking warning을 끕니다.
  대소문자 구분 없음 (`true`/`True`/`TRUE`).
- **`gk status -v`에 `[base]` 진단 라인** — `resolved=… source=…
  origin/HEAD=… cfg=…` key=value 한 줄. 미스매치 / origin/HEAD unset 시 ⚠
  꼬리표가 붙습니다.

### Changed

- **`gk status` base 해석을 단일 호출로 hoist**. 이전에는 `runStatusOnce`가
  `resolveBaseForStatus`를 최대 3회 호출하던 것을 `BaseResolution`을 1회 계산
  후 `renderBaseDivergence` / `renderStatusVerboseSummary`에 인자로 전달하도록
  refactor. 매 status 4-10개 git subprocess가 줄었습니다.
- **Tracking 검출이 단일 `git config --get-regexp`로 통합**. 이전에는 3개
  별도 lookup(`gk-tracking-ok`, `merge`, `remote`)이었으나 1회 spawn으로
  줄였습니다.
- **`--legend` "base" 섹션** — 새 라벨 어휘(`default` / `configured` /
  `guessed`)와 mismatch footer 설명을 반영합니다.

## [0.20.0] - 2026-04-29

### Added

- **`gk status --json`** — 머신 판독용 JSON 출력. `repo`/`branch`/`upstream`/
  `ahead`/`behind`/`clean`/`next` 헤더, `counts`(committable/split/staged/
  modified/untracked/conflicts/dirty_submodules), `entries[]`, `submodules[]`.
  모든 사람-가독 문자열은 `stripControlChars`로 sanitize됩니다.
- **`gk status --exit-code`** — 셸 스크립트용 종료 코드: 0=clean, 1=dirty,
  2=submodule-only, 3=conflicts, 4=behind. 우선순위는 conflict > dirty >
  submodule-only > behind > clean. `--watch`와 동시 사용은 거부됩니다.
- **`gk status --watch [--watch-interval D]`** — 인터럽트 전까지 N초 간격으로
  상태를 갱신. 기본 2s. `--json`/`--exit-code`와 충돌 시 거부.
- **서브모듈 worktree-only dirtiness 분류 (`KindSubmodule`).** porcelain v2의
  `.M S.M.` / `.M S..U` 레코드(superproject `git add`로 commit 불가능한 nested
  변경)를 감지해 별도 카테고리로 표시합니다. `gk commit`도 분류 결과에서
  drop합니다. `IsSubmoduleWorktreeDirtinessOnly` 헬퍼는 `internal/git`에서
  export되며 `internal/aicommit/gather.go`도 이를 호출합니다.

### Changed

- **`compactUpstreamSuffix`가 항상 `<remote>/<branch>` 전체를 표시.** 이전에는
  로컬 브랜치 이름과 upstream 브랜치 이름이 일치하면 `→ origin`으로 줄였으나,
  `main → origin` 같은 모호한 출력을 막기 위해 dedup 로직을 제거했습니다.
- **`StatusEntry`에 `Sub` 필드 추가.** porcelain v2의 submodule 필드(`N...` /
  `S.M.` 등)를 보존합니다. `parseRenamedEntry`/`parseUnmergedEntry`도
  `Sub`를 읽어 rename·unmerged 서브모듈도 `KindSubmodule`로 분류합니다.
- **`renderSubmoduleSection` 시그니처에서 `ctx`가 첫 인자로 이동.** Go convention
  준수.
- **`runStatus`의 `os.Exit` 호출이 `statusExitFunc` 인디렉션으로 분리됨.**
  테스트에서 종료 코드를 검증할 수 있도록.

## [0.19.0] - 2026-04-29

### Fixed

- **Rename groupings now stay in a single commit.** `gk commit`이 staged
  rename(`git mv` 등)을 처리할 때, AI grouper가 새 경로만 그룹에 emit하면
  원본 삭제 측이 `git commit -- <pathspec>`에 포함되지 않아 인덱스에
  dangling staged deletion으로 남던 버그를 수정. `ApplyMessages`는 이제
  commit 루프 진입 전 `git diff --cached --name-status -z -M`로 staged
  rename pair(`new → orig`)를 한 번 수집하고, 각 그룹의 commit pathspec을
  expand해 원본 삭제 측 경로를 함께 커밋합니다. 새 헬퍼는
  `internal/aicommit/apply.go`의 `stagedRenamePairs`/`expandRenamePairs`.

### Changed

- **AI 분류 prompt와 Gemini diff 헤더에 rename 원본 경로가 노출됩니다.**
  `provider.FileChange`에 `OrigPath` 필드 추가 — classifier prompt는
  `- new.go [renamed from old.go]`, diff 헤더는
  `--- new.go (renamed from old.go)`로 출력. LLM이 rename을 delete+add
  페어로 오해해 그룹을 분리하는 빈도를 줄이는 것이 목적입니다.

## [0.18.0] - 2026-04-29

### Added

- **브랜치별 fork-parent 메타데이터 (`gk branch set-parent`/`unset-parent`).**
  Stacked workflow 사용자가 `git config branch.<name>.gk-parent <parent>`로
  실제 부모 브랜치를 등록하면, `gk status`가 main 대신 parent 기준으로
  ahead/behind를 출력합니다 (`from feat/parent ↑2 ↓0 → ready to merge into feat/parent`).
  - Write-time 검증: self/cycle (depth ≤10)/non-branch/tag/존재 안 함 모두 거부.
    오타는 Levenshtein 기반 fuzzy 제안 ("did you mean 'main'?").
    Remote-tracking ref 거부는 실제 `git remote` 목록 기반 — 휴리스틱 아님.
  - parent 가리키는 브랜치가 삭제된 경우 stderr에 1-line 경고 후 base로
    silent fallback — status 출력 자체는 base 라인으로 유지됩니다.
  - 신규 패키지 `internal/branchparent/`. Phase 1은 storage + status 통합만;
    추론 알고리즘 (reflog 기반 자동 parent 감지) 및 `gk switch`/`gk worktree`
    parent 인지는 Phase 2 예정. sync/merge/ship은 의도적으로 제외 — 변경
    명령에는 명시적 `--base` 인자가 더 안전합니다.
- **`gk status`의 `base` 시각화 레이어 기본 활성화.** 이전에는 `--vis base`로
  opt-in해야 했던 `from <trunk> ↑N ↓M [hint]` 라인이 기본 출력. 액션 힌트도
  추가됐습니다 — `→ ready to merge into main` (ahead-only, clean tree),
  `→ behind main: gk sync` (behind-only), `→ main moved: gk sync` (diverged).
  - **Perf 영향:** 일반 사용자의 `gk status` baseline이 약 +6-12ms 증가합니다
    (`git rev-list --left-right` 1회 + `git config --get` 1회 추가 spawn).
    parent metadata가 설정된 브랜치에서는 추가로 `git rev-parse --verify` 1회
    더 호출됩니다 (~+1-2ms). 기존 ≤10ms budget을 약간 넘기지만, 머지 판단
    신호의 가시성 향상이 비용을 정당화합니다. opt-out하려면 `.gk.yaml`의
    `status.vis`에서 `base`를 제외하세요.

### Changed (BREAKING)

- **`gk sync`가 "현재 브랜치를 base로 따라잡기"로 재정의됨.** 기본 전략은 rebase.
  v0.6의 `gk sync`는 "fetch + 현재 브랜치를 `origin/<self>`로 FF"였는데, 이는
  사용자가 가장 흔히 원하는 인텐트(피처 브랜치를 trunk로 따라잡기)와 어긋나
  있었습니다. 재설계로 gk의 통합 커맨드 3개가 서로 겹치지 않게 정리됩니다:
  `sync`(base → 현재, 기본 rebase), `pull`(`@{u}` ↔ 현재), `merge <x>`(머지
  커밋을 동반한 의도적 통합).
  - 신규 플래그: `--base`, `--strategy rebase|merge|ff-only`.
  - `.gk.yaml`의 `sync.strategy`는 신규 키 — `pull.strategy`와 분리.
  - **Self-FF (always-on):** `origin/<self>`가 로컬보다 strictly ahead일 때,
    base 통합 전에 자동 FF. diverge 시 조용히 스킵.
  - **`--upstream-only` (deprecated, v0.8 제거):** v0.6 동작을 한 사이클
    유지. stderr에 한 줄 deprecation 안내. CI 로그용 무음화는
    `GK_SUPPRESS_DEPRECATION=1`. v0.8 이후엔 `gk pull`을 사용.
  - **`--all` 제거.** 모든 로컬 브랜치를 base로 rebase하는 동작은 위험하고
    드물게 의도된 것이라 제거. 필요하면 shell 루프로 수동 처리.
  - 충돌 처리는 동일 — `gk continue` / `gk abort` / `gk resolve`로 재개.
  - 자세한 내용은 `docs/commands.md#gk-sync` 및 `docs/rfc-sync-redesign.md`.

## [0.15.0] - 2026-04-28

### Added

- **`gk ship` release automation.** 새 명령은 `status`, `dry-run`, `squash`, `auto`, `patch|minor|major` 모드를 지원하고, clean/base-branch 확인, 최신 tag 기준 SemVer bump 추론(`feat` → minor, breaking → major, 그 외 patch), local-only squash, configured preflight 실행, `VERSION`/`package.json`/`marketplace.json` version bump, `CHANGELOG.md [Unreleased]` 승격, release commit, annotated tag 생성, branch/tag push까지 묶습니다. `v*` tag push는 기존 GitHub Actions release workflow를 트리거하므로 GoReleaser 기반 GitHub Release/Homebrew tap 배포까지 이어집니다.
- **`gk merge <target>` AI-planned guarded merge.** 실제 `git merge` 전에 `merge-tree` 기반 precheck를 실행하고 AI-assisted merge plan을 기본 출력합니다. Provider가 없으면 동일 git facts 기반 fallback plan을 출력합니다. 충돌이 예측되면 plan을 보여주고 merge를 차단하며, `--plan-only`, `--no-ai`, `--provider`, `--ff-only`, `--no-ff`, `--no-commit`, `--squash`, `--skip-precheck`, `--autostash`를 지원합니다.

## [0.14.1] - 2026-04-27

### Internal

- **Dead code 제거.** `internal/cli/init.go`의 미사용 `//go:embed templates/ai/{CLAUDE,AGENTS,kiro-*}.md` directive 16줄, `internal/initx/aictx.go`의 미사용 `claudeMDTemplate` / `agentsMDTemplate` raw string 변수 약 160줄 (`kiro*Template` 3종은 v0.13.0의 `gk init --kiro`에서 사용 중이므로 유지), `internal/cli/log.go`의 미사용 `must` 제네릭 헬퍼, `internal/cli/status.go`의 미사용 `colorXY` 한 줄 함수가 모두 v0.13.0 redesign 이후 호출처가 사라진 dead code였습니다. 외부 동작에 영향 없음.
- **`golangci-lint --fix` 적용.** `staticcheck QF1001`(De Morgan 단순화)을 `internal/cli/log.go:resolveLogVis`, `internal/cli/status.go:454`, `internal/cli/ai_commit_test.go:64`에 적용 (semantic equivalent). gofmt 정렬을 `internal/aicommit/privacy_gate{,_test}.go`, `internal/ai/provider/{groq,nvidia,fallback_test,summarizer_test}.go`, `internal/cli/{log,status,worktree,ai_review,init,ai_commit_test,ai_changelog_test,ai_pr_test,status_test}.go`, `internal/initx/{aictx,configgen,writer,writer_test,analyzer_test}.go`, `internal/policy/policy_test.go`에 일괄 복원 — 이전 formatter run으로 드리프트했던 struct field 주석 정렬을 canonical 형태로 통일.

### Tooling

- **`/release` skill을 defaults-first single-gate 흐름으로 재작성** (`.claude/skills/release/SKILL.md`). Phase 1-6 (PREFLIGHT / PROPOSE / CONFIRM / EXECUTE / VERIFY / REPORT) 구조로 정리하고, 이전에 4번 호출되던 `AskUserQuestion`(release 전략 / 버전 / CHANGELOG / 커밋 구조)을 Phase 3 단일 게이트로 통합. 버전 bump · CHANGELOG 본문 · 커밋 구조를 working tree와 `[Unreleased]` 상태에서 자동 추론하고 사용자는 한 번만 확정합니다. 또한 `golangci-lint`를 hard preflight requirement로 추가. binary에는 포함되지 않는 개발 도구 변경입니다.

## [0.14.0] - 2026-04-27

### Changed

- **`gk ai <subcommand>`가 `gk <subcommand>`로 평탄화되었습니다 (breaking).** `commit`, `pr`, `review`, `changelog`이 root command에 직접 위치합니다 — `gk commit`, `gk pr`, `gk review`, `gk changelog`. 4개 명령은 non-AI counterpart가 없어 namespacing 이득이 없었고 `ai` 글자의 마찰만 남았기 때문입니다. `--show-prompt` flag도 root persistent flag로 이동되어 모든 상위 명령에서 redacted-payload audit를 그대로 사용 가능합니다. 에러 메시지 prefix도 개정되었습니다 (`"ai commit: ..."` → `"commit: ..."`). `README.md`, `README.ko.md`, `docs/commands.md`, `docs/config.md` 모두 새 명령 형태로 갱신되었습니다.

### Removed

- **`gk ai` parent command 및 `AICmd()` exported accessor.** alias는 제공하지 않습니다 — `gk ai commit` 등을 쓰던 스크립트/CI는 새 top-level 형태로 수정해야 합니다. rename은 mechanical하므로 sed 수준 교체(`gk ai ` → `gk `)로 충분합니다.

## [0.13.1] - 2026-04-26

### Fixed

- **Secret-gate false positives on `generic-secret`.** The catch-all `key/secret/token=...` regex was firing on obvious placeholders in checked-in samples and templates. The scan now skips lines containing `your_`, `your-`, `<your`, `example`, `placeholder`, `xxx`, `changeme`, `replace_me`, `todo`, `fixme`, `dummy`, `sample`, `test_key`, `test_secret`, `fake_key`, or `fake_secret`. Real-key patterns (AKIA, ghp_, sk-…) are unaffected — they ride dedicated kinds, not `generic-secret`.
- **`gk ai commit` aborting on test fixtures.** The `isTestFile` check used by the secret gate now recognizes `_test.rs`, `_test.py`, `_spec.rb`, `*.test.tsx`, `*.test.jsx`, plus any path under `testdata/`, `tests/`, `__tests__/`, `fixtures/`, or `test_fixtures/`. Files whose basename contains `test`, `mock`, `fake`, `fixture`, `example`, `redact`, `sample`, `stub`, or `dummy` are also treated as fixtures. Mock data and redaction examples no longer block commit runs.

### Changed

- **`gk init` default IDE gitignore patterns include `.claude/`** alongside `.idea/`, `.vscode/`, `.cursor/`, `.kiro/`, `.xm/`, `.omc/`. New repos scaffolded with `gk init` won't accidentally check in their per-IDE Claude Code settings.

### Docs

- **Linux manual-download instructions** added to both `README.md` and `README.ko.md`. Homebrew remains the recommended path on macOS, but Linux users now have a copy-pasteable curl-and-tar one-liner (amd64 + arm64) plus a manual three-step fallback.
- **`README.ko.md` synced with v0.13.0.** Adds the Groq provider row, updates the auto-detect order to `nvidia → groq → gemini → qwen → kiro-cli`, and lists the `ai.groq:` block in the example `.gk.yaml`. The `--provider` flag enumeration is also brought into line.
- **`/release` skill (`.claude/skills/release/SKILL.md`) auto-syncs README + docs/commands.md by default** when the CHANGELOG promotion exposes a missing command or flag. The skill drafts entries from structured sources (`gk <cmd> --help`, the promoted CHANGELOG section, Cobra `Use`/`Short`/`Long` strings, recent commits) and surfaces the diff for review before the release commit. The previous "ask first, never auto-generate prose" rule is replaced with transcription guidance — match flag descriptions to `--help`, mark uncertainty with `<!-- review: ... -->` instead of guessing, and never invent flags that have no source backing. Auto-drafting stays scoped to structured surface; tutorials and rationale narratives still belong to a human editor.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-04-26

### Added

- **`gk init` redesigned as a one-shot project bootstrap.** Running `gk init` now analyzes the repository (language stack, frameworks, build tools, CI configs) and scaffolds three artifacts in a single pass: a `.gitignore` baseline (language/IDE/security rules, optionally augmented by AI-suggested project-specific patterns via the new `GitignoreSuggester` capability), a repo-local `.gk.yaml` with sensible defaults including the `ai.commit.deny_paths` baseline, and (with `--kiro`) `.kiro/steering/{product,tech,structure}.md` for Kiro-compatible assistants. An interactive [huh](https://github.com/charmbracelet/huh) form previews the analysis result and the planned writes before anything touches the filesystem; non-TTY callers (CI, piped output) fall back automatically. Use `--only gitignore|config|ai` to run a single target, `--dry-run` to preview, `--force` to overwrite. `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` are no longer scaffolded — Claude Code and Jules generate (and continually refresh) their own context files, so a static template would be stale before its first commit.
- **`internal/initx` package** — `analyzer.go` (filesystem-driven detection of language stack / frameworks / build tools / CI configs), `configgen.go` (`.gk.yaml` rendering from `AnalysisResult`), `gitignore.go` (language/IDE/security baseline), `ai_gitignore.go` (provider-suggested augmentation), `aictx.go` (Kiro steering files), and `writer.go` (atomic write with skip-if-exists semantics). Each module is independently testable and consumed by `gk init`.
- **`gk config init`** — relocated `gk init config` under the canonical `config` namespace. Same flags (`--force`, `--out <path>`), same auto-init behavior on first `gk` run. `gk init config` is preserved as a backward-compatible alias and now delegates to this command.
- **Groq AI provider** (`internal/ai/provider/groq.go`) — HTTP provider talking to the Groq Chat Completions API (OpenAI-compatible). Reads `GROQ_API_KEY` from the environment; default model `llama-3.3-70b-versatile`. Slotted into the auto-detect order **after** `nvidia` and **before** the CLI-shelling providers: `nvidia → groq → gemini → qwen → kiro-cli`. Implements `Classifier`, `Summarizer`, and `GitignoreSuggester` capabilities by sharing the HTTP invoke path with `Nvidia`.
- **`GitignoreSuggester` optional capability** (`internal/ai/provider/gitignore.go`) — providers can suggest project-specific `.gitignore` patterns from a filesystem snapshot. Implemented for `nvidia`, `groq`, `gemini`, `qwen`, and `kiro`. The system prompt is conservative — only patterns that are NOT already covered by the standard language/IDE/security baseline. Detected via type assertion, mirroring the `Summarizer` pattern, so providers without the capability are skipped silently.

### Changed

- **Secret-gate findings now carry the originating file path and a file-relative line number** for built-in scanner hits. The aggregated diff payload is parsed for `### path` and `diff --git a/X b/X` headers and each builtin finding is mapped back to its file. Brings parity with the `gitleaks` adapter, which already reported per-file location. Output is now navigable when the gate aborts a `gk ai commit` run.
- **Auto-detect provider order** is now `nvidia → groq → gemini → qwen → kiro-cli` (was `nvidia → gemini → qwen → kiro-cli`). HTTP providers come first because they have no install-time prerequisites beyond an environment variable.
- **`AIConfig` gains an `AIGroqConfig` block** (`model`, `endpoint`, `timeout`) parallel to `AINvidiaConfig`. Default timeout is 60s; defaults are written into `Defaults()` so the field is always present even when the user has not configured it.
- **README provider table and config snippets** now list `groq` alongside `nvidia` as a no-binary HTTP option, with the corresponding `ai.groq:` block in the example `.gk.yaml`.

### Internal

- The `gk init ai` subcommand survives as a hidden alias for backward compatibility, but no longer emits `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` — those files are now self-managed by the assistants themselves.
- `init_config.go` is reduced to a one-line backward-compat shim (`var runInitConfig = runConfigInit`) so existing tests continue to compile.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-04-26

### Added

- **`gk ai pr`** — generate a structured PR description (Summary, Changes, Risk Assessment, Test Plan) from the commits on the current branch. `--output clipboard` copies the result directly via the platform clipboard; `--dry-run` previews the redacted prompt without invoking the provider; `--lang` controls the output language. Pulls the same provider/privacy-gate plumbing as `gk ai commit` so secrets and `deny_paths` matches never leave the machine.
- **`gk ai review`** — AI-powered code review on the staged diff (`git diff --cached`) or an arbitrary range (`--range ref1..ref2`). Returns a per-file finding list with severity (`error` / `warn` / `info`), a one-line rationale, and an optional fix suggestion. `--format json` emits NDJSON for CI consumption; the default human format groups findings under their file headers.
- **`gk ai changelog`** — generate a Keep-a-Changelog-style block grouped by Conventional Commit type from a commit range. Defaults to `<latest-tag>..HEAD`; override via `--from` / `--to`. Useful for drafting release notes — the output is meant as a starting point for human editing, not the final word.
- **NVIDIA provider** (`internal/ai/provider/nvidia.go`) — first-class HTTP provider that calls the NVIDIA Chat Completions API directly. No external binary required; reads `NVIDIA_API_KEY` from the environment. Now the **default** in the auto-detect chain (`nvidia → gemini → qwen → kiro-cli`), so a fresh install with the API key set works out of the box. Implements both `Classifier` and the new `Summarizer` capability.
- **Privacy Gate for remote providers.** Every payload routed to a `Locality=remote` provider passes through the gate, which redacts `internal/secrets` matches and `deny_paths` glob hits with tokenized placeholders (`[SECRET_1]`, `[PATH_1]`) before the prompt leaves the machine. Aborts when more than 10 secrets are detected (signal that something is fundamentally wrong). Use the new global `--show-prompt` flag on any `gk ai` subcommand to inspect the exact redacted payload that would be sent.
- **Provider Fallback Chain.** When no explicit `--provider` is given, gk tries each available provider in auto-detect order and moves to the next on failure (network error, missing API key, CLI not installed, exhausted quota). The chain is short-circuited only by user-cancelable errors (e.g. user denies the privacy-gate confirmation). Restored after the v0.11.x revert; `internal/ai/provider/fallback.go` is now covered by dedicated tests.
- **Summarizer capability.** Providers that opt in (currently only `nvidia`) can pre-summarize oversized diffs before classification, so very large working trees no longer overflow the model's context window. Other providers will gain support in future releases.
- **`--show-prompt`** — global flag on the `gk ai` command tree. Prints the exact (privacy-gate-redacted) payload that would be sent to the provider and exits without making the network call. Useful for auditing what gk is about to share and for debugging prompt regressions.

### Changed

- **`gk ai commit` classifier prompt prefers fewer groups.** The system instruction now explicitly tells the classifier to keep related changes (implementation + its config + its docs) in a single group and to split only when files serve clearly different purposes. Reduces the rate of overzealous splits where a single coherent change was sliced into 3-4 noise commits.
- **Secret scan skips test files.** `summariseForSecretScan` now ignores files matching `_test.go`, `*.test.ts`, `*.test.js`, `*.spec.ts`, `*.spec.js`. Unit tests for the scanner itself contain intentional fake secrets (e.g. `AKIA…` strings as test fixtures), and the previous behavior aborted `gk ai commit` whenever those files appeared in the working tree. The files are still passed to the AI classifier — only the gate skips them.
- **`gk doctor` now reports an `nvidia` provider row** alongside `gemini`, `qwen`, and `kiro-cli`. Detects whether `NVIDIA_API_KEY` is set in the environment and surfaces a one-line auth hint when it is not.

### Performance

- **AI provider call path tightened.** `internal/ai/provider/httpclient.go` consolidates request construction and response parsing for HTTP-backed providers (currently nvidia), trimming a hot allocation per call. CLI-shelling providers (`gemini`, `qwen`, `kiro`) had their `runner` factored out so subprocess spawn + stdin pipe + stdout drain reuse a single `runner.Exec` path instead of duplicating boilerplate per provider.

### Fixed

- **Privacy gate now applies to all remote providers**, not just `gk ai commit`. Earlier, `gk ai pr` / `gk ai review` / `gk ai changelog` could route raw diffs straight to a remote model on certain code paths. Every `gk ai` subcommand now goes through the same gate.

### Internal

- `internal/ai/provider/factory.go` — provider construction unified behind a single factory; covers nvidia, gemini, qwen, kiro, fake, and the fallback wrapper.
- `internal/aicommit/privacy_gate.go` — extracted from `ai_commit.go` so the gate is shared by every `gk ai` subcommand.
- Test coverage: new tests for `factory`, `fallback`, `httpclient`, `nvidia`, `summarizer`, `privacy_gate`, `ai_changelog`, `ai_pr`, `ai_review`, and a top-level `ai_integration_test.go` that wires a fake provider through the full `commit/pr/review/changelog` paths.
- `gopkg.in/yaml.v3` and related dependencies vendored via `go.mod`; `Makefile` gains a property-based-test build target.
- Repo-local `.gk.yaml` — ships an explicit `ai.commit.deny_paths` baseline (`.env*`, `*.pem`, `id_rsa*`, `credentials.json`, `*.pfx`, `*.kdbx`, `*.keystore`, `service-account*.json`, `terraform.tfstate*`) so the gate has a sensible default even before users edit their config.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-04-23

### Added

- **Global `-d, --debug` flag (and `GK_DEBUG=1` env var).** Every subcommand gains a diagnostic log channel to stderr, rendered in dim gray so the stream visually recedes behind real command output. Lines are tagged with `[debug +N.NNNs]` showing elapsed time since the first debug call, so wall time attribution is immediate — e.g. `[debug +0.042s] ai commit: classify ok — 3 groups` vs `[debug +2.815s] ai commit: compose ok — 3 message(s) in 2.773s` tells you the model call is the hot path. Root-level `PersistentPreRunE` installs two subprocess hooks (`git.ExecHook` and `provider.ExecHook`) on every invocation, so every git command and every AI CLI call is logged with its argv, duration, and exit status — no per-command opt-in. Stage boundaries are annotated in `pull` (base/upstream/strategy resolution, dirty check, ff-optimization), `push` (protected/secret-scan/argv), `clone` (spec→URL→target), `worktree add` (raw→resolved→managed layout), and `ai commit` (provider/preflight/gather/gate/classify/compose).
- **Spinner feedback for long stages in `gk ai commit`.** Previously the command sat silently while the classifier or composer waited on an external AI CLI. Now each stage (secret-gate scan, classify, compose) prints a status line and starts a 150ms-delayed braille spinner on stderr, reusing the pattern from `gk status`'s quiet fetch. Non-TTY stderr (CI, piped output) stays clean — the status lines remain but the animation is suppressed. Spinner code lives in `internal/ui/spinner.go` and is available for future long-running commands.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-04-23

### Added

- **`gk init config` + first-run auto-init.** A fully-commented YAML template now lands at `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gk/config.yaml` (fallback `~/.config/gk/config.yaml`) the first time any `gk` command runs, so users have a single, discoverable file to edit instead of guessing field names from `gk config show`. The auto-init prints one `gk: created default config at <path>` line to stderr on creation and is silent on every subsequent run. Explicit `gk init config [--force] [--out <path>]` is the discoverable counterpart — regenerate the template, write a repo-local `.gk.yaml`, or opt into `--force` for a clean reset. Disable the auto-init entirely with `GK_NO_AUTO_CONFIG=1`; write failures (read-only home, sandbox, bad XDG path) are swallowed so gk always runs. Template covers every supported section including the new `ai:` block.
- **`gk ai commit`** — cluster working-tree changes (staged + unstaged + untracked) into semantic commit groups via an external AI CLI (`gemini`, `qwen`, `kiro-cli`) and apply one Conventional Commit per group. Provider resolves via `--provider` → `ai.provider` in config → auto-detect (`gemini → qwen → kiro-cli`); each adapter calls the CLI over stdin (`-p` / positional / `--no-interactive`) so no LLM API keys live inside `gk`. Interactive TUI review by default, `-f/--force` skips review, `--dry-run` previews only, `--abort` restores HEAD to the latest `refs/gk/ai-commit-backup/<branch>/<unix>` ref. Safety rails run on every invocation: `internal/secrets` + `gitleaks` (when installed) gate every payload and abort on findings; `deny_paths` globs keep `.env*`, `*.pem`, `id_rsa*`, `credentials.json`, `*.kdbx`, lockfiles, and `terraform.tfstate` out of provider prompts; `gitstate.Detect` refuses to run mid-rebase / merge / cherry-pick; `commit.gpgsign=true` without a `user.signingkey` aborts before the LLM is ever invoked; a path-based classifier (`_test.go`, `docs/*.md`, CI yamls, lockfiles) overrides the provider's type pick to prevent "test classified as feat" hallucinations; and every generated message is validated with `internal/commitlint.Lint` with up to two retries threading the lint issues back into the prompt. Provider/version recording via `AI-Assisted-By` trailer and `.git/gk-ai-commit/audit.jsonl` logging are both opt-in (`ai.commit.trailer` / `ai.commit.audit`, default off). Flags: `-f/--force`, `--dry-run`, `--provider`, `--lang`, `--staged-only`, `--include-unstaged`, `--allow-secret-kind`, `--abort`, `--ci`, `-y/--yes`. `gk doctor` now reports a row per provider (install + auth hint) and explicitly distinguishes the `kiro-cli` headless binary from the `kiro` IDE launcher.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-04-23

### Added

- **`gk wt` interactive TUI.** Running `gk wt` (or `gk worktree`) without a subcommand opens a loop over the worktree list with actions for cd / remove / add-new.
  - **cd** spawns a fresh `$SHELL` inside the selected worktree (like `nix-shell`) — type `exit` to return to the original shell at its original cwd. Inside the subshell `$GK_WT` and `$GK_WT_PARENT_PWD` expose the path contract. Pass `--print-path` to opt into the shell-alias pattern instead: `gwt() { local p="$(gk wt --print-path)"; [ -n "$p" ] && cd "$p"; }`.
  - **remove** understands dirty/locked/stale states: dirty/locked worktrees get a follow-up "force-remove anyway?" prompt; stale admin entries auto-prune; after a clean remove gk offers to delete the orphan branch.
  - **add new** resolves orphan-branch collisions inline with a three-way choice (reuse / delete-and-recreate / cancel), so a prior failed `worktree add -b` no longer leaves users locked out.
  - Non-TTY callers get the usual help output.
- **`gk worktree add` managed base directory.** Relative name arguments now land under `<worktree.base>/<worktree.project>/<name>` (default `~/.gk/worktree/<basename>/<name>`) instead of the caller's cwd. Absolute paths still passthrough. Two clones with the same basename (e.g. `work/gk` and `personal/gk`) can disambiguate via `worktree.project` in `.gk.yaml`. Intermediate directories are created automatically; subdir names like `feat/api` are preserved under the managed root.
- **`gk status --xy-style labels|glyphs|raw`** — per-entry state column is now self-documenting by default. The cryptic two-letter porcelain code (`??`, `.M`, `MM`, `UU`) is replaced with word labels (`new`, `mod`, `staged`, `conflict`) on every row. Pass `--xy-style glyphs` for a compact one-cell marker (`+` `~` `●` `⚔` `#`), or `--xy-style raw` / `status.xy_style: raw` to restore the previous git-literate rendering. Glyph mode collapses states into five broad categories for dashboard density; label mode preserves per-action granularity. Also fixes a latent bug where `DD`/`AA` unmerged conflicts were colored yellow instead of red.
- **`gk pull` post-integration summary.** Previously `gk pull` ended with a terse `integrating origin/main (ff-only)...` line even when it pulled in a dozen commits — the user had to run `git log` separately to see what actually changed. The new summary prints the pre/post HEAD range, commit count, a one-line listing of each new commit (SHA, subject, author, short age; capped at 10 with a `+N more` footer), and a `--shortstat` diff summary. When nothing changed, a single `already up to date at <sha>` line confirms HEAD. `gk pull --no-rebase` (fetch-only) now reports how many upstream commits are waiting and whether HEAD has diverged, replacing the opaque `done (fetch only)` message.
- **`gk clone <owner/repo | alias:owner/repo | url> [target]`** — short-form URL expansion for cloning. Bare `owner/repo` expands to `git@github.com:owner/repo.git` (SSH by default; configurable via `clone.default_protocol`/`clone.default_host`). `--ssh`/`--https` flip protocol for a single invocation. Scheme URLs (`https://`, `ssh://`, `git://`, `file://`) and SCP-style `user@host:path` strings pass through unchanged. New config:
  - `clone.hosts` — alias table so `gk clone gl:group/svc` resolves to `git@gitlab.com:group/svc.git` (per-alias `host` + optional `protocol`).
  - `clone.root` — opt-in Go-style layout; when set, bare `owner/repo` lands at `<root>/<host>/<owner>/<repo>`.
  - `clone.post_actions` — run `hooks-install` and/or `doctor` inside the fresh checkout once the clone succeeds. Failures warn but never fail the clone.
  - `--dry-run` prints the resolved URL + target and exits without touching the network.
- **`gk status -f, --fetch`** — opt-in upstream fetch. Debounced, 3-second hard timeout, silent on failure (all safety bounds from the previous auto-fetch path remain intact).
- **narrow-TTY adaptation for `gk status` and `gk log`**: tree compresses 3-cell indent to 2-cell under 60 cols and drops the `(N)` subtree badge under 40 cols; types-chip budget-truncates tail tokens with a `+N more` suffix; heatmap directory column caps at `ttyW-22` with rune-aware ellipsis (fixes mid-codepoint truncation on CJK path names); `gk log --calendar` caps weeks at `(ttyW-4)/4`.

### Changed

- **`gk status` fetch is now opt-in.** The quiet upstream fetch introduced in v0.6.0 used to run on every invocation, which surfaced confusing noise (and `fatal: ...` fallout) on repos with no remote, detached HEAD, or an unreachable remote. New default: zero network activity — `gk status` reads only local state. Pass `-f` / `--fetch` to refresh the upstream ref for the ↑N ↓N counts. To restore the old always-fetch behavior, set `status.auto_fetch: true` in `.gk.yaml`.
- **Removed**: `--no-fetch` flag and `GK_NO_FETCH` env var — both existed only as opt-outs for the now-removed default.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-04-23

### Added

- **`gk init ai`** — scaffolds `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` in the repository root so AI coding assistants (Claude Code, Jules, Copilot Workspace, Gemini CLI, etc.) have immediate project context. Pass `--kiro` to also scaffold `.kiro/steering/product.md`, `tech.md`, and `structure.md` for Kiro-compatible assistants. Files are skipped (not overwritten) when they already exist; `--force` opts in to overwrite. `--out <dir>` writes to a custom directory instead of the repo root.
- **`gk log --legend`** — prints a one-time glyph/color key for every active log visualization layer (`--vis cc`, `--vis safety`, `--vis impact`, etc.) and exits. Mirrors `gk status --legend`.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-04-23

### Added

- **`gk timemachine`** — new command tree that surfaces every recoverable HEAD state (reflog + `refs/gk/*-backup/`) and lets you restore any of them safely.
  - `gk timemachine restore <sha|ref>` — mixed/hard/soft/keep reset with an atomic backup ref written first. Flags: `--mode soft|mixed|hard|auto` · `--dry-run` · `--autostash` · `--force`. In-progress rebase/merge/cherry-pick states are refused even with `--force`. Full safety invariants live in [`docs/roadmap-v2.md`](docs/roadmap-v2.md#tm-18-runner-call-map).
  - `gk timemachine list` — unified timeline (`reflog` + `backup` + opt-in `stash` + opt-in `dangling`) newest-first, with `--kinds`, `--limit`, `--all-branches`, `--branch`, `--since`, `--dangling-cap`, and `--json` (NDJSON) for scripting. The `dangling` source runs `git fsck --lost-found`; the default cap is 500 entries so large repos do not hang.
  - `gk timemachine list-backups` — just the gk-managed backup refs, with `--kind` filter and `--json`.
  - `gk timemachine show <sha|ref>` — commit header + diff stat (or `--patch`) for any timeline entry; auto-prepends a `gk backup: kind=… branch=… when=…` line when the ref is under `refs/gk/*-backup/`.
  - Every restore prints the backup ref + a ready-to-paste `gk timemachine restore <backupRef>` revert hint.
- **`internal/gitsafe`** — new shared package that centralizes the "backup ref + reset" dance. `gitsafe.Restorer` implements a 6-step atomic contract (snapshot → backup → autostash → reset → pop → verify) with structured `RestoreError` stages for precise failure reporting. `gitsafe.DecideStrategy` codifies the hard-reset decision table so CLI and TUI consume one contract. Used internally by `gk undo`, `gk wipe`, and `gk timemachine restore`.
- **`internal/timemachine`** — unified `Event` stream type and source readers (`ReadHEAD`, `ReadBranches`, `ReadBackups`) plus `Merge` / `Limit` / `FilterByKind` utilities. Consumed by `gk timemachine list`.
- **`gk guard check`** — first policies-as-code surface. Evaluates every registered rule in parallel and prints sorted violations (error → warn → info) in human or `--json` NDJSON format. Ships one rule (`secret_patterns`) that delegates to gitleaks when installed and emits an info-level no-op violation otherwise. Exit codes: 0 clean / 1 warn / 2 error.
- **`gk guard init`** — scaffolds `.gk.yaml` in the repo root with a fully-commented `policies:` block.
- **`gk hooks install --pre-commit`** — new hook that wires `gk guard check` as a git `pre-commit` hook so policy rules run automatically before every commit. `selectHooks` was refactored to iterate `knownHooks()` generically so future hooks only need a `hookSpec` entry and a flag — no branch edits. Every rule stub (`secret_patterns`, `max_commit_size`, `required_trailers`, `forbid_force_push_to`, `require_signed`) is commented-out so the file is valid YAML from day one and users opt in explicitly. Also documents the `.gk/allow.yaml` per-finding suppression convention. Flags: `--force` (overwrite) · `--out <path>` (custom destination).
- **`internal/policy`** — new package hosting the `Rule` interface, `Registry`, and `Violation` schema. Rules declare `Name()` + `Evaluate(ctx, Input)`; the Registry runs them in parallel and sorts results deterministically.
- **`internal/policy/rules.SecretPatternsRule`** — the first rule. Thin adapter: calls `scan.RunGitleaks` and maps `GitleaksFinding` → `policy.Violation`.
- **`internal/scan`** — new package for secret-scanner adapters. Ships `FindGitleaks`, `ParseGitleaksFindings`, `RunGitleaks(ctx, opts)` (exit 1 = findings, not error), and `ErrGitleaksNotInstalled` sentinel. Per the 2026-04-22 probe, gk prefers the industry-standard gitleaks over a rebuilt scanner.

### Changed

- **`gk wipe` now runs a preflight check.** A repo with a rebase/merge/cherry-pick in progress used to let `gk wipe --yes` plough ahead and leave a half-broken state; it now refuses with the same `in-progress … run 'gk continue' or 'gk abort' first` message `gk undo` has always produced.
- **`gk undo` preflight refactored** to use `internal/gitsafe`. No user-visible behavior change; the old `*git.ExecRunner` type-assertion (which silently disabled in-progress detection under `FakeRunner` in tests) was replaced with an explicit `WithWorkDir` option.
- **`gk doctor` gains a `gk backup refs` row.** Counts refs under `refs/gk/*-backup/`, breaks down by kind (`undo`/`wipe`/`timemachine`), and surfaces the age of the oldest/newest — so a repo accumulating stale backup refs is visible at a glance.
- **`gk doctor` gains a `gitleaks` row.** Detects the `gitleaks` binary and its version. Lays groundwork for the gk-guard secret-scanner evaluator (post-probe decision: prefer the industry-standard gitleaks over a rebuilt scanner). WARN when absent with a brew/go install suggestion.

### Removed

- Private `backupRefName` / `wipeBackupRefName` / `safeBranchSegment` / `updateRef` / `resolveRef` helpers in `internal/cli/` — callers now use the exported `gitsafe.BackupRefName` / `gitsafe.Restorer` / `gitsafe.ResolveRef` equivalents. Ref naming format and stdout hints are byte-compatible with v0.6.

### Docs

- [`docs/commands.md`](docs/commands.md) gains a full **gk timemachine** section covering `list`, `list-backups`, and `restore` with flag tables, JSON schema, and examples.
- [`docs/roadmap-v2.md`](docs/roadmap-v2.md) remains the canonical design reference for the v2 surface (62 leaves, ship slices, Restorer runner call map, TM-14 decision table, kill criteria from the probe).
- TODO: document `gk push`, `gk sync`, `gk precheck`, `gk preflight`, `gk doctor`, `gk hooks`, `gk undo`, `gk restore`, `gk edit-conflict`, `gk lint-commit`, `gk branch-check` in `docs/commands.md` (pre-existing gaps inherited from 0.2.0 / 0.3.0).

## [0.6.0] - 2026-04-22

### Added

- `gk status` default rendering is now tree-based with a staleness-aware branch line. The shipped `status.vis` default is `[gauge, bar, progress, tree, staleness]`, so bare `gk status` already looks distinctly un-like `git status`: ahead/behind becomes a divergence gauge, file state becomes a stacked composition bar, cleanup reads as a progress meter, the file list is a path trie with collapsed single-child chains, and `· last commit 3d ago` plus `(14d old)` markers surface abandoned WIP automatically. The classic sectioned output is still one flag away (`gk status --vis none`).
- `gk status --vis base` — appends a second `from <trunk> [gauge]` line on feature branches showing divergence from the repo's mainline (resolved via `base_branch` config → `refs/remotes/<remote>/HEAD` → `main`/`master`/`develop`). Suppressed on the base branch itself. One `git rev-list --left-right --count` call (~5–15 ms).
- `gk status --vis since-push` — appends `· since push 2h (3c)` to the branch line when the current branch has unpushed commits. Age is the oldest unpushed commit; count is total unpushed. One `git rev-list @{u}..HEAD --format=%ct` call (~5 ms).
- `gk status --vis stash` — adds a `stash: 3 entries · newest 2h · oldest 5d · ⚠ 2 overlap with dirty` summary when the stash is non-empty. Overlap warning intersects the top stash's files with current dirty paths so the common `git stash pop` footgun is visible before you trigger it. 1–2 git calls (~5–10 ms total).
- `gk status --vis heatmap` — 2-D density grid above the entry list: rows are top-level directories, columns are `C` conflicts / `S` staged / `M` modified / `?` untracked, each cell scales ` `→`░`→`▒`→`▓`→`█` with the peak count. Purpose-built for 100+ dirty-file states where the tree scrolls off-screen. Zero extra git calls (pure aggregation over porcelain output).
- `gk status --vis glyphs` — prepends a semantic file-kind glyph to every entry (flat + tree): `●` source · `◐` test · `◆` config · `¶` docs · `▣` binary/asset · `↻` generated/vendored · `⊙` lockfile · `·` unknown. Classification is pure path matching (lockfile > generated > test > docs > config > binary > source) so a `package-lock.json` is `⊙` not `◆ JSON` and `foo_test.go` is `◐` not `●`. Zero file I/O, zero git calls.
- `gk status --top N` — truncates the entry list to the first N rows, sorted alphabetically for stable output, and emits a faint `… +K more (total · showing top N)` footer so the truncation is never silent. Composes with every viz layer; default `0` means unlimited.
- `gk status --no-fetch` — skip the quiet upstream fetch for this invocation. Also honored via `GK_NO_FETCH=1` or `status.auto_fetch: false` in `.gk.yaml`. The fetch itself was introduced in v0.6.0: by default `gk status` does a short, strictly-bounded fetch of the current branch's upstream so ↑N ↓N reflects the live remote (see "Changed" below for the full contract).
- `gk log` default rendering switches to a viz-aware pipeline. The shipped `log.vis` default is `[cc, safety, tags-rule]`, so bare `gk log` now shows a Conventional-Commits glyph column (`▲` feat · `✕` fix · `↻` refactor · `¶` docs · `·` chore · `◎` test · `↑` perf · `⊙` ci · `▣` build · `←` revert · `✧` style) with an inline-colored subject prefix and a trailing `types: feat=4 fix=1` tally, plus a left-margin rebase-safety marker (`◇` unpushed / `✎` amended / blank when already pushed), plus `──┤ vX.Y.Z (3d) ├──` rules before tagged commits.
- `gk log` relative age column is now compact (`6d` / `3m` / `1h` / `now` / `3mo` / `2y`) instead of git's verbose `6 days ago`. Saves 8–10 characters per row and disambiguates minutes (`m`) from months (`mo`).
- `gk log --impact` — appends an eighths-bar scaled to per-commit `+adds -dels` size.
- `gk log --hotspots` — marks commits that touch the repo's top-10 most-churned files from the last 90 days with `🔥`.
- `gk log --trailers` — appends a `[+Alice review:Bob]` roll-up parsed from `Co-authored-by:` / `Reviewed-by:` / `Signed-off-by:` trailers.
- `gk log --lanes` — replaces the commit list with per-author horizontal swim-lanes on a shared time axis; top 6 authors keep their own lane, the rest collapse into an `others` lane.
- `gk log --pulse` — prints a commit-rhythm sparkline above the log (one cell per day, `▁▂▃▄▅▆▇█` scaled to the peak, `·` for zero).
- `gk log --calendar` — prints a 7-row × N-week heatmap above the log (`░▒▓█` scaled to the busiest bucket, capped at 26 weeks).
- `gk log --tags-rule` — inserts a cyan `──┤ v0.4.0 (3d) ├────` separator line before any commit whose short SHA matches a tag. Handles annotated tags via `%(*objectname:short)`.
- `gk log --cc` / `--safety` — can be combined or subtracted via append semantics: `gk log --impact` keeps the default set and adds impact; `gk log --cc=false` peels cc off the default; `gk log --vis cc,impact` replaces the default entirely.
- `gk sw` with no argument now lists both local AND remote-only tracking branches in the picker. Local entries render with `●` in green; remote-only entries render with `○` in cyan and auto-run `git switch --track <remote>/<name>` when chosen, creating the local tracking branch in one step. `refs/remotes/*/HEAD` aliases are filtered; remote entries whose short name matches a local branch are hidden.
- Auto-fetch progress spinner on stderr. When `gk status` fetches and the call is slow enough to notice (>150 ms), a single-line braille-dot spinner (`⠋⠙⠹⠸⠼⠴⠦⠧⠇⠏`) animates on stderr with a `fetching <remote>...` label. Non-TTY stderr (pipes, CI, `2>file`) disables it so pipelines stay clean.
- `make install` / `make uninstall` targets. Default `INSTALL_NAME=gk-dev` writes to `$(PREFIX)/bin/gk-dev` so a local build never shadows the Homebrew-managed `gk`. Override with `make install INSTALL_NAME=gk` to replace both.
- Config: `log.vis`, `status.vis`, `status.auto_fetch` keys. Both viz defaults are fully configurable via `.gk.yaml` — projects can pin their own layer set.

### Changed

- `gk status` now auto-fetches the current branch's upstream before reading porcelain output so `↑N ↓N` counts reflect the actual remote state, not the last-cached view. Scope is strictly bounded: single upstream ref only (no `--all`, no tags, no submodule recursion, no `FETCH_HEAD` write); 3-second hard timeout via context; `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0` + empty `SSH_ASKPASS` block credential prompts from hijacking the terminal; stderr discarded so remote chatter never interleaves with output; silent on every error path. Debounced with a per-repo marker file (`$GIT_COMMON_DIR/gk/last-fetch`) — subsequent invocations within a 3-second window skip the network round-trip entirely. Fast path checks `.git/gk/last-fetch` directly with zero git spawns, so warm calls measured at ~17 ms (vs ~60 ms cold). Opt out with `--no-fetch`, `GK_NO_FETCH=1`, or `status.auto_fetch: false`.
- `gk status` default visualization expanded from `[gauge, bar, progress]` (v0.5.0) to `[gauge, bar, progress, tree, staleness]`. Bare `gk status` now looks distinctly un-like `git status` — see Added above.
- `gk log` auto-detects viz intent: when the default `log.vis` is active, rendering switches from git's raw pretty-format to gk's layered pipeline. Explicit `--format <fmt>` alone suppresses the default (so the raw pretty-format stays in control); `--format` combined with an explicit viz flag preserves the viz (the user explicitly asked for both).
- Log CC glyphs redesigned to be uniformly single-cell geometric Unicode (`▲✕↻¶·◎↑⊙▣←✧`) instead of gitmoji (`✨🐛♻📝🧹🧪🚀🤖🏗↩💄`). Emoji varied in cell width across fonts, broke column alignment, and felt tonally at odds with the rest of the CLI. Geometric glyphs stay 1 cell wide in every modern monospace font and avoid collision with the safety column's `◆/◇/✎/!` markers.
- Log safety column no longer prints a glyph for the `already pushed` state — only `◇` (unpushed), `✎` (amended-in-last-hour), and blank. On an active branch virtually every commit is already pushed, so the old `◆` filled every row and drowned out the signal. The column width is preserved so alignment stays intact.
- `log` viz flag semantics are append-by-default: an individual flag like `--impact` stacks on top of the configured default; `--vis <list>` replaces it entirely; `--vis none` empties the baseline. This matches user intuition ("add impact to my normal view") over v0.5.0's "explicit = replace" semantics.
- `--vis gauge` on a clean tree now renders `[·······│·······] in sync` instead of nothing. Same for `--vis bar` → `tree: [·················] (clean)` and `--vis progress` → `clean: [██████████] 100% nothing to do`. Previously these layers silently skipped on clean trees, making users unsure whether the flag took effect.
- `--vis safety` on a pushed commit now renders a blank column (not `◆`) so only notable push-states draw attention.

### Performance

- `gk status` warm-call latency improved from ~60 ms to ~17 ms via a two-step optimization: (1) upstream + git-common-dir lookup collapsed into a single `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD@{u} --git-common-dir` call, and (2) a fast-path `os.Stat` on the debounce marker that skips every git spawn when the last fetch is under 3 s old. Repeated `gk st` invocations within the debounce window now run faster than the previous no-fetch path (~21 ms) because the upstream lookup is also skipped.

### Tooling

- Release workflow (this skill) now runs documentation-sync verification in Step 3b before cutting the tag. Extracts every `gk <cmd>` / `--flag` token from the promoted version section and checks both `README.md` and `docs/commands.md` for coverage; missing tokens trigger an `AskUserQuestion` to either document now or track via a TODO line.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-22

### Added

- `gk status --vis <list>` — opt-in visualizations for the working-tree summary. Accepts a comma-list or repeated flags; all are composable on top of the existing sectioned output.
  - `gauge` — replaces `↑N ↓N` with a fixed-width divergence gauge `[▓▓│····]`, green ahead blocks and red behind blocks anchored at the upstream marker. Narrows to 3 slots/side under 80-col TTYs.
  - `bar` — stacked composition bar of conflicts/staged/modified/untracked counts, each segment using a distinct block glyph (`▓█▒░`) so the bar stays readable under `--no-color`.
  - `progress` — one-line "how close to clean" meter (staged / total) plus a remaining-verb list (`resolve N · stage N · commit N · discard-or-track N`).
  - `types` — one-line extension histogram (`.ts×6 .md×2 .lock×1`). Collapses `package-lock.json` / `go.sum` / `Cargo.lock` / `Gemfile.lock` / `Pipfile.lock` / `poetry.lock` / `composer.lock` / `pnpm-lock.yaml` / `yarn.lock` into a single `.lock` kind; falls back to basename for extensionless files (`Makefile`, `Dockerfile`). Dims binary/lockfile kinds. Suppressed above 40 distinct kinds.
  - `staleness` — annotates the branch line with `· last commit 3d ago` and appends `(14d old)` to untracked entries older than a day. Ages collapse to the largest unit with 1–3 digits (`45s`, `12m`, `3h`, `11d`, `6w`, `4mo`, `2y`).
  - `tree` — replaces the flat sections with a path trie. Single-child directory chains collapse (`src/api/v2/auth.ts` renders as one leaf) to avoid deep indentation. Directory rows carry a subtree-count badge `(N)`.
  - `conflict` — appends `[N hunks · both modified]` (or `added by them`, `deleted by us`, etc.) to each conflicts entry. Hunk count is derived from `<<<<<<<` markers in the worktree file; conflict kind maps from the porcelain XY code.
  - `churn` — appends an 8-cell sparkline to each modified entry showing per-commit add+del totals for its last 8 commits, oldest-left / newest-right. Suppressed when the dirty tree has more than 50 files.
  - `risk` — flags high-risk modified entries with `⚠` and re-sorts the section so the hottest files are on top. Score is `current diff LOC + distinct-author-count-over-30d × 10`, threshold 50.

- `gk log` visualization flags — all composable and independent of each other; they layer on top of the default pretty-format log.
  - `--pulse` — commit-rhythm sparkline strip printed above the log, bucketed per day across the `--since` window. Zero-activity days render as `·`, active days scale to `▁▂▃▄▅▆▇█` relative to the peak, followed by `(N commits, peak Tue)`.
  - `--calendar` — 7-row × N-col heatmap (Mon..Sun by ISO week) using `░▒▓█` scaled to the busiest bucket. Capped at 26 weeks for terminal sanity.
  - `--tags-rule` — post-processes log stdout and inserts a cyan `──┤ v0.4.0 (3d ago) ├───` rule before any commit whose short-SHA matches a tag. Handles annotated tags via `%(*objectname:short)`.
  - `--impact` — eighths-bar `████▊ +412 −38` scaled to the run's peak diff size. Numstats come from a second `git log --numstat --format=%H` pass to keep the primary record stream simple.
  - `--cc` — Conventional-Commits glyph prefix (`✨` feat · `🐛` fix · `♻` refactor · `📝` docs · `🧹` chore · `🧪` test · `🚀` perf · `🤖` ci · `🏗` build · `↩` revert · `💄` style) + a `types: feat=4 chore=1` footer tallying the types in the visible range.
  - `--safety` — `◆` already-pushed · `◇` unpushed · `✎` amended-in-last-hour. Batched via `git rev-list @{upstream}` and a reflog scan; no per-commit git calls.
  - `--hotspots` — `🔥` on commits that touch any of the repo's top-10 most-touched files from the last 90 days (minimum 5 touches to qualify as a hotspot).
  - `--trailers` — `[+Alice review:Bob]` roll-up parsed from `Co-authored-by:` / `Reviewed-by:` / `Signed-off-by:` trailers in the commit body.
  - `--lanes` — alternate view: one horizontal swim-lane per author with `●` markers on a shared time axis. Top 6 authors keep their own lane; the tail collapses into a synthetic `others` lane. Width follows TTY (floor 10 cols), name column capped at 15 chars.

- `ui.TTYWidth()` exported from `internal/ui` so subcommands can adapt layouts to the terminal width.

### Changed

- `gk status` branch line no longer emits `↑N ↓N` when `--vis gauge` is active — the gauge carries the same information in a richer form.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-22

### Added

- `gk wipe [--yes] [--dry-run] [--include-ignored]` — discard ALL local changes and untracked files (`git reset --hard HEAD` + `git clean -fd`, or `-fdx` with `--include-ignored`). Before wiping, gk records a backup ref at `refs/gk/wipe-backup/<branch>/<unix>` so local commits remain recoverable (untracked files are not). Requires TTY confirmation or `--yes`; `--dry-run` prints the plan without touching the tree. Absorbs the oh-my-zsh `gpristine` / `gwipe` pattern with a safety net.
- `gk wip` / `gk unwip` — quick throwaway commit for context switching. `gk wip` stages every tracked change (`git add -A`) and commits with subject `--wip-- [skip ci]`, skipping hooks and signing for speed. `gk unwip` refuses unless HEAD's subject starts with `--wip--`, then runs `git reset HEAD~1` so the changes return to the working tree. Mirrors oh-my-zsh's `gwip` / `gunwip` with an explicit refusal guard.
- `gk reset --to-remote` — hard-reset the current branch to `<remote>/<current-branch>` regardless of the configured upstream. Useful when a branch has drifted from origin but has no `branch.<name>.merge` set. Mutually exclusive with `--to`. Absorbs oh-my-zsh's `groh` (`git reset origin/$(git_current_branch) --hard`) with the same confirm + dry-run safety as `gk reset`.
- `gk branch list --gone` — filter to branches whose upstream has been deleted on the remote. Detects the `[gone]` track state via `for-each-ref --format='…%00%(upstream:track)'`. Complements the existing `--stale <N>` / `--merged` filters.
- `gk branch list --unmerged` — mirror of `--merged`; lists branches NOT merged into the base (`git branch --no-merged <base>`). Mutually exclusive with `--merged`.
- `gk branch clean --gone` — delete local branches whose upstream is gone while respecting the protected list (current branch, configured `branch.protected`). Pairs with `--force` to use `branch -D` when a gone branch carries unmerged commits. Absorbs oh-my-zsh's `gbgd` / `gbgD`.
- `gk switch -m` / `--main` and `-d` / `--develop` — jump to the repo's canonical main or develop branch without typing its name. `--main` resolves via `client.DefaultBranch` first (honors `refs/remotes/<remote>/HEAD`) then falls back to local `main` or `master`; `--develop` tries `develop` then `dev`. Mutually exclusive; incompatible with a branch argument or `--create`. Absorbs `gcm` / `gcd` / `gswm` / `gswd`.
- `gk push` — when the current branch has no configured upstream, push now auto-adds `--set-upstream` so the first push wires it up. Removes the `fatal: The current branch has no upstream branch` speed bump without needing a separate alias. Absorbs oh-my-zsh's `ggsup` behavior.
- README: Install section documents the oh-my-zsh `git` plugin alias conflict (`alias gk='\gitk --all --branches &!'`, `alias gke='\gitk --all ...'`) and points to `unalias gk gke 2>/dev/null` as the resolution.
- Release skill (`.claude/skills/release/SKILL.md`): new **Step 3b — Documentation sync verification** between the CHANGELOG rewrite and the tag push. Parses `gk <cmd>` / `gk <cmd> --flag` tokens out of the just-promoted version section and requires each one to appear in `README.md` and `docs/commands.md`; a binary-vs-docs drift pass using `gk --help` is offered as an optional sanity check. Gaps block the release by default; the skill asks before proceeding with TODOs.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-22

### Changed

- Error output now includes a `hint:` line when the command can suggest a concrete next step. Implemented via `cli.WithHint(err, hint)` + `cli.FormatError(err)`; hint is extracted through `errors.Unwrap` chains so wrapping with `fmt.Errorf("%w")` still surfaces the hint. `cmd/gk/main.go` renders both lines. Initial hint sites: `gk precheck` unknown target (suggests `git fetch` / typo), `gk sync` dirty tree (`gk sync --autostash`), `gk pull` dirty tree (`gk pull --autostash`).

### Added

- `gk hooks install [--commit-msg] [--pre-push] [--all] [--force]` / `gk hooks uninstall` — write/remove thin POSIX shim scripts under `.git/hooks/`. Installed hooks carry a `# managed by gk` marker; the installer refuses to overwrite any hook missing the marker unless `--force` is passed (which writes a timestamped `.bak` backup first). Honors `core.hooksPath` and worktree `--git-common-dir`. Currently installs `commit-msg` → `gk lint-commit` and `pre-push` → `gk preflight`. Updates `gk doctor`'s remediation hint so it points at the installer.
- `gk doctor [--json]` — non-invasive environment report. Seven checks with PASS/WARN/FAIL status and copy-paste fix hints: git version (>= 2.38 required, >= 2.40 preferred), pager (delta → bat → less), fzf, editor ($GIT_EDITOR/$VISUAL/$EDITOR resolution), config (validates all load layers + reports repo-local `.gk.yaml`), and hook install state for `commit-msg` and `pre-push`. Exit 0 unless any FAIL row is present. `--json` emits machine-readable output for CI/onboarding scripts.
- `gk sync [--all] [--fetch-only] [--no-fetch] [--autostash]` — fetch remotes and fast-forward local branches to their configured upstreams. Never creates merge commits, never rebases. Current branch uses `git merge --ff-only`; other branches (`--all`) are advanced via `git update-ref` after an `is-ancestor` check. Diverged branches return a new `DivergedError` (exit 4) with a clear hint to use `gk pull`. Default fetch scope is `--all --prune`; narrows to a configured `remote` when set and `--all` is not passed.
- `gk precheck <target>` — dry-run a merge without touching the working tree. Runs `git merge-tree --write-tree --name-only --merge-base` and reports conflicted paths. Exit 0 clean, exit 3 on conflicts, exit 1 on unknown target. Supports `--base <ref>` to override the auto-computed merge-base and `--json` for CI consumption. Rejects refs starting with `-` to prevent argv injection.
- `internal/cli/precheck.go` — new `scanMergeConflicts` helper, shared with preflight's `no-conflict` alias. Prefers `--name-only` on git ≥ 2.40; falls back to `<<<<<<<` marker parsing for git 2.38/2.39 (reports paths as non-enumerable on that path).

### Fixed

- `runBuiltinNoConflict` (preflight's `no-conflict` step) — migrated to the shared `scanMergeConflicts` helper, which passes `--merge-base <oid>` as a flag. Latent bug: the prior 3-positional form (`merge-tree <base> <ours> <theirs>`) was removed in recent git and failed with a usage dump. Now reports the specific conflict count in the error message.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-21

### Added

**Safer rebasing**

- `gk undo` — reflog-based HEAD restoration. Shows recent reflog entries in a picker (fzf when available, numeric fallback otherwise) and runs `git reset --mixed <sha>` to the chosen point. Working tree is always preserved.
- Automatic backup ref at `refs/gk/undo-backup/<branch>/<unix>` before every undo. The command prints `git reset --hard <ref>` to revert the undo trivially.
- Preflight guards: blocks undo when the tree is dirty or a rebase/merge/cherry-pick is in progress, steering the user to `gk continue` / `gk abort`.
- Flags: `--list` (script-safe, print only), `--limit N`, `--yes` (skip confirmation), `--to <ref>` (skip picker, for automation).

- `gk restore --lost` — surfaces dangling commits and blobs from `git fsck --lost-found --unreachable`, sorted newest-first with subject + short SHA. Prints ready-to-paste `git cherry-pick` / `git branch <name> <sha>` hints.

- `gk edit-conflict` / `gk ec` — opens `$EDITOR` at the first `<<<<<<<` marker. Editor-aware cursor jump for vim / nvim / vi / emacs / nano / micro (via `+N`), VS Code / Code-Insiders (via `--goto file:N`), sublime / helix (via `file:N`). Falls back to bare path for unknown editors. `--list` mode prints paths only for scripting.

**Preflight & conventions**

- `gk lint-commit [<rev-range>|--file PATH|--staged]` — validates commit messages against Conventional Commits. Installable as a commit-msg hook (`gk lint-commit --file $1`). Six rules: header-invalid, type-empty, type-enum, scope-required, subject-empty, subject-max-length.

- `gk branch-check [--branch NAME] [--patterns REGEX,...]` — enforces branch-naming patterns. Default pattern: `^(feat|fix|chore|docs|refactor|test|perf|build|ci|revert)/[a-z0-9._-]+$`. Branches on the protected list (main/master/develop) bypass the check. Prints an example branch name when the pattern has a clear prefix group.

- `gk push [REMOTE] [BRANCH] [--force] [--skip-scan] [--yes]` — guarded push wrapper.
  - Scans the commits-to-push diff (`<remote>/<branch>..HEAD`) with built-in secret patterns: AWS access/secret keys, GitHub classic + fine-grained tokens, Slack tokens, OpenAI keys, private-key PEM headers, and generic `key/secret/token/password` literal assignments.
  - Protected-branch force pushes require typing the exact branch name at the prompt (`--yes` skips it only when a TTY is available).
  - `--force` routes through `--force-with-lease` to avoid clobbering upstream.

- `gk preflight [--dry-run] [--continue-on-failure] [--skip NAME,...]` — runs the configured step sequence. Built-in aliases: `commit-lint`, `branch-check`, `no-conflict` (pre-merge scan via `git merge-tree --write-tree`). User-defined steps execute as `sh -c` commands and surface output on failure.

**CLI ecosystem hooks**

- `internal/ui/pager.go` — pager detection library. Priority: `GK_PAGER` → `PAGER` → PATH lookup (`delta` → `bat` → `less`). Tuned default args per binary, respects `NO_COLOR`, auto-passes TTY width to delta.
- `internal/ui/fzf.go` — reusable `Picker` interface with `FzfPicker` (stdin pipe + `--preview`) and `FallbackPicker` (numeric prompt). `NewPicker()` auto-selects based on `fzf` availability and TTY state. Consumed by `gk undo`.
- `internal/reflog` — Conventional Commits-independent reflog parser. `Read()` pulls via `git reflog --format=...`, `Parse()` handles the NUL/RS-delimited raw bytes, and `classifyAction()` maps messages into 11 coarse-grained actions (reset/commit/merge/rebase/checkout/pull/push/branch/cherry-pick/stash/unknown).

**Config extensions**

- `commit.{types, scope_required, max_subject_length}` — Conventional Commits rule set.
- `push.{protected, secret_patterns, allow_force}` — push safety rails.
- `preflight.steps[{name, command, continue_on_failure}]` — ordered check list with built-in aliases.
- `branch.{patterns, allow_detached}` — naming policy alongside the existing `stale_days` / `protected`.
- Sensible defaults ship in `config.Defaults()` so every new command works out of the box without a `.gk.yaml` file.

### Changed

- `internal/git/client.go` — fixed off-by-one in `parsePorcelainV2` for untracked entries (`tok[3:]` → `tok[2:]`); the path's first character was being dropped.
- `.goreleaser.yaml` — removed placeholder comments now that the tap repo is real.

### Fixed

- `internal/ui/fzf_test.go` — `TestFzfPicker_SkipWhenNoFzf` no longer hangs on non-TTY environments. Now skips when stdout/stdin are not a TTY and wraps the Pick call in a 2-second context timeout as a safety net.

### Tooling

- `.claude/skills/release/SKILL.md` — `/release` slash command automates: prerequisite checks → version bump prompt → local validation → CHANGELOG migration → tag + push → GitHub Actions monitoring → Homebrew tap verification. Diagnostic matrix for 401 / 403 / 422 failure modes with concrete recovery actions.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-20

### Added

- `gk pull` — fetch + rebase with auto base-branch detection (`origin/HEAD` → `develop` → `main` → `master`). Supports `--base`, `--no-rebase`, and `--autostash`.
- `gk log` / `gk slog` — customizable short log with `--since` shortcuts (`1w`, `3d`, `12h`), `--graph`, `--limit`, and `--format`.
- `gk status` / `gk st` — concise working tree status using `git status --porcelain=v2 -z`. Shows staged, unstaged, untracked, and conflicted files plus ahead/behind counts.
- `gk branch list` — list local branches with `--stale <N>` and `--merged` filters.
- `gk branch clean` — delete merged branches while respecting the configured protected list. Supports `--dry-run` and `--force`.
- `gk branch pick` — interactive branch picker (TUI prompt with plain-list fallback for non-TTY).
- `gk continue` — continue an in-progress rebase, merge, or cherry-pick after conflict resolution. Supports `--yes` to skip prompt.
- `gk abort` — abort an in-progress rebase, merge, or cherry-pick and restore previous state. Supports `--yes` to skip prompt.
- `gk config show` — print the fully resolved configuration as YAML.
- `gk config get <key>` — print a single config value by dot-notation key.
- Config loading priority: built-in defaults → `~/.config/gk/config.yaml` (XDG) → repo-local `.gk.yaml` → `git config gk.*` → `GK_*` environment variables → CLI flags.
- Global automation flags: `--dry-run`, `--json`, `--no-color`, `--repo`, `--verbose`.
- Per-command automation flags: `--yes` (continue/abort), `--autostash` (pull).
- Safety: `LC_ALL=C` and `GIT_OPTIONAL_LOCKS=0` enforced on all git calls; `core.quotepath=false` set; user-supplied refs validated with `git check-ref-format` and separated by `--` to prevent argv injection.
- Exit code convention: 0 success, 1 general error, 2 invalid input, 3 conflict, 4 config error, 5 network error.
- goreleaser configuration for cross-platform builds (darwin/linux × amd64/arm64) and Homebrew tap distribution.
