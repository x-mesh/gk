# gk Command Reference

All subcommands accept the following global flags:

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--dry-run` | Print actions without executing |
| `--json` | JSON output where supported |
| `--no-color` | Disable color output |
| `--repo <path>` | Path to git repo (default: current directory) |
| `--verbose` | Verbose output |

---

## gk pull

Fetch and rebase the current branch onto the base branch.

### Synopsis

```
gk pull [flags]
```

### Flags

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--base <branch>` | auto-detect | Base branch to rebase onto |
| `--autostash` | false | Stash dirty changes before rebase, pop after |
| `--no-rebase` | false | Only fetch, do not rebase |

### Base branch auto-detection

When `--base` is not set and `base_branch` is not configured, gk probes in this order:

1. `origin/HEAD` (remote default branch)
2. `develop`
3. `main`
4. `master`

### Examples

```bash
# Fetch and rebase onto auto-detected base branch
gk pull

# Rebase onto a specific branch
gk pull --base develop

# Fetch only, skip rebase
gk pull --no-rebase

# Stash uncommitted changes, rebase, then restore
gk pull --autostash

# Preview what would happen without executing
gk pull --dry-run
```

### Notes

- Requires a clean working tree unless `--autostash` is set. If the tree is dirty and `--autostash` is not set, gk exits with an error and prints guidance.
- Runs `git fetch <remote> <base>` then `git rebase origin/<base>`.
- On conflict, gk pauses and prompts. Use `gk continue` or `gk abort` to resume.

---

## gk log

Show a short, colorful commit log.

### Synopsis

```
gk log [revisions] [-- <path>...] [flags]
gk slog [revisions] [-- <path>...] [flags]
```

`slog` is an alias for `log`.

### Flags

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--format <fmt>` | (config `log.format`) | git `--pretty=format` string |
| `--graph` | false | Include topology graph |
| `-n, --limit <N>` | 20 | Max number of commits (0 = unlimited) |
| `--since <duration>` | | Show commits since this time |
| `--pulse` | false | Print a commit-rhythm sparkline above the log |
| `--calendar` | false | Print a 7-row × N-week heatmap above the log |
| `--tags-rule` | false | Insert a `──┤ v0.4.0 (3d ago) ├──` rule before each tagged commit |
| `--impact` | false | Append an eighths-bar scaled to per-commit `+adds -dels` |
| `--cc` | false | Prepend a geometric type glyph (`▲` feat · `✕` fix · `↻` refactor · `¶` docs · `·` chore · `◎` test · `↑` perf · `⊙` ci · `▣` build · `←` revert · `✧` style) + inline-color the matching subject prefix + append a `types: feat=4 fix=1` tally |
| `--safety` | false | Mark notable push-state: `◇` unpushed · `✎` recently amended · blank for the normal "already pushed" case so the column stays quiet until something deserves attention |
| `--hotspots` | false | Mark commits that touch the repo's top-10 most-churned files |
| `--trailers` | false | Append a `[+Alice review:Bob]` roll-up from commit trailers |
| `--lanes` | false | Replace the commit list with per-author swim-lanes on a time axis |
| `--vis <list>` | `cc,safety,tags-rule` (from `log.vis`) | Visualization set (comma-list or repeated). Any explicit viz flag (`--vis` or an individual flag like `--cc`) overrides the configured default. Pass `--vis none` to disable all layers; setting `--format` alone also suppresses the default. |

### Default visualization layers

When `gk log` is invoked with no viz flag, it applies the set in `log.vis`
(default `[cc, safety, tags-rule]`). The resolver works in two steps:

**Step 1 — baseline**
- `--vis <list>` replaces the baseline entirely (the "start fresh" form).
- `--vis none` empties the baseline.
- `--format <fmt>` with nothing else suppresses the baseline so the raw
  pretty-format stays in control.
- Otherwise the configured `log.vis` is the baseline.

**Step 2 — individual flags layer on top**
- `--cc`, `--impact`, `--safety`, ... (true) add the name to the set.
- `--cc=false` removes it from the set (handy to peel one layer off the
  default without rewriting the full list).

Concrete examples:

| Command | Effective set |
|---------|---------------|
| `gk log` | `cc, safety, tags-rule` (from config) |
| `gk log --impact` | `cc, safety, tags-rule, impact` (default + impact) |
| `gk log --cc=false --impact` | `safety, tags-rule, impact` (drop cc, add impact) |
| `gk log --vis cc,impact` | `cc, impact` (replace) |
| `gk log --vis cc,impact --trailers` | `cc, impact, trailers` |
| `gk log --vis none` | (none) |
| `gk log --vis none --impact` | `impact` (start empty, add impact) |
| `gk log --format "%H %s"` | (none — raw pretty-format wins) |
| `gk log --format "%H" --cc` | `cc` (format suppresses default; --cc re-enables one layer) |

### Since shortcuts

The `--since` flag accepts git-native strings and short forms:

| Input | Equivalent |
|-------|-----------|
| `1w` | `1 week ago` |
| `3d` | `3 days ago` |
| `12h` | `12 hours ago` |
| `"last monday"` | `last monday` |

### Examples

```bash
# Show last 20 commits (default)
gk log

# Show commits from the past week
gk log --since 1w

# Show last 50 commits with graph
gk log -n 50 --graph

# Show commits touching a specific file
gk log -- README.md

# Show commits on a specific branch
gk log main

# Show commits since 3 days ago on a path
gk log --since 3d -- internal/

# Visualizations (all composable)
gk log --pulse --since 30d                # sparkline of daily commit counts
gk log --calendar --since 12w             # 7-row × 12-week heatmap
gk log --tags-rule                        # separator row before each tagged commit
gk log --cc --impact                      # CC glyphs + per-commit LOC bars
gk log --safety --hotspots --trailers     # push state + hotspot marker + trailer roll-up
gk log --lanes                            # author swim-lanes instead of commit list
```

### Notes

- The default format shows: short hash, relative age, author name, subject, and ref decorations.
- Override the format permanently via `log.format` in your config file. See [docs/config.md](config.md).
- `--json` outputs a JSON array of commit objects.

---

## gk status

Show concise working tree status.

### Synopsis

```
gk status [flags]
gk st [flags]
```

`st` is an alias for `status`.

### Flags

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--vis <list>` | `gauge,bar,progress` (from `status.vis`) | Visualization layers (comma-list or repeated). Pass `--vis none` to disable all layers for a single invocation. Values: `gauge`, `bar`, `progress`, `types`, `staleness`, `tree`, `conflict`, `churn`, `risk`. |
| `--no-fetch` | false | Skip the quiet upstream fetch that keeps ↑N ↓N counts current. Also honored via `GK_NO_FETCH=1` or `status.auto_fetch: false`. |

### Upstream auto-fetch

By default, `gk status` attempts a short fetch of the current branch's upstream ref (the one recorded in `branch.<name>.remote` / `branch.<name>.merge`) before reading porcelain output, so the ↑N ↓N counts reflect the actual remote state rather than the last-cached view. The fetch is intentionally scoped and safe:

- Only the single upstream ref is fetched — no `--all`, no `--tags`, no submodule recursion, no FETCH_HEAD write.
- A 3-second hard timeout means a slow or flaky remote never blocks status beyond that budget.
- `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0` + empty `SSH_ASKPASS` prevent credential prompts from hijacking the terminal.
- stderr is discarded so `remote: …` chatter does not interleave with status output.
- On any failure (offline, auth expired, timeout) the fetch is silently dropped and status renders with the local cached view.

Disable globally with `status.auto_fetch: false`, per-invocation with `--no-fetch`, or via `GK_NO_FETCH=1`. When upstream is not configured (detached HEAD or brand-new branch) the fetch is skipped without network activity.

#### `--vis` values

| Value | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| `gauge` | Replaces `↑N ↓N` with a divergence gauge `[▓▓│····]` (ahead on the left, behind on the right, upstream marker in the middle). |
| `bar` | Stacked `[▓████▒▒░░░]` bar whose segments are proportional to conflicts/staged/modified/untracked counts. |
| `progress` | `clean: [███░░░░░░░] 30%  stage 5 · commit 3 · resolve 1 · discard-or-track 1` — staged ratio + remaining-verb list. |
| `types` | Extension histogram (`.ts×6 .md×2 .lock×1`). Collapses known lockfile basenames to `.lock`; dims binary/lockfile kinds. Suppressed above 40 distinct kinds. |
| `staleness` | Annotates the branch line with `· last commit Xd ago` and untracked entries older than a day with `(14d old)`. |
| `tree` | Replaces the flat sections with a hierarchical path trie. Single-child directory chains collapse; directory rows carry a subtree-count badge `(N)`. |
| `conflict` | Appends `[N hunks · both modified]` to each conflicts entry. Hunk count is derived from `<<<<<<<` markers in the worktree file. |
| `churn` | Appends an 8-cell sparkline to each modified entry (per-commit add+del totals over the file's last 8 commits). Suppressed when the dirty tree has more than 50 files. |
| `risk` | Flags high-risk modified entries with `⚠` and re-sorts the section so the hottest files are on top. Score is `diff LOC + distinct-authors-over-30d × 10`, threshold 50. |

### Examples

```bash
# Show working tree status
gk status

# Short alias
gk st

# JSON output
gk status --json

# Default viz (gauge + bar + progress)
gk status

# Disable all viz for a single run
gk status --vis none

# Override the default: only the divergence gauge
gk status --vis gauge

# Multiple visualizations (either syntax works)
gk status --vis gauge,bar,progress
gk status --vis gauge --vis bar --vis progress

# Hierarchical view with conflict detail
gk status --vis tree,conflict

# Risk-weighted sort plus churn sparklines
gk status --vis risk,churn
```

### Output format

Output groups files by state:

- **Staged** — changes added to the index
- **Unstaged** — tracked files with uncommitted modifications
- **Untracked** — new files not yet added
- **Conflicted** — files with merge/rebase conflicts

Also shows ahead/behind commit counts relative to the upstream branch.

When `--vis tree` is active, the flat sections are replaced by a single hierarchical tree.

### Notes

- Uses `git status --porcelain=v2 -z` internally for reliable, locale-independent parsing.
- `LC_ALL=C` is enforced for all git calls.

---

## gk branch

Branch management helpers.

### Synopsis

```
gk branch <subcommand> [flags]
```

### Subcommands

| Subcommand | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `list` | List branches with optional stale/merged filters |
| `clean` | Delete merged branches (respecting protected list) |
| `pick` | Interactively choose a branch to checkout |

---

### gk branch list

List local branches with optional filters.

#### Synopsis

```
gk branch list [flags]
```

#### Flags

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--merged` | false | Only show branches merged into base |
| `--unmerged` | false | Only show branches NOT merged into base (mirror of `--merged`) |
| `--gone` | false | Only show branches whose upstream has been deleted on the remote |
| `-s, --stale <N>` | 0 (all) | Only show branches with last commit older than N days |

`--merged` and `--unmerged` are mutually exclusive.

#### Examples

```bash
# List all local branches
gk branch list

# List branches not touched in 30+ days
gk branch list --stale 30

# List branches already merged into base
gk branch list --merged

# List branches NOT merged into base
gk branch list --unmerged

# List branches whose remote was deleted (typical after a PR merge + branch delete)
gk branch list --gone

# Combine filters
gk branch list --stale 14 --merged
```

---

### gk branch clean

Delete local branches, skipping protected branches.

#### Synopsis

```
gk branch clean [flags]
```

#### Flags

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--dry-run` | false | Show what would be deleted without deleting |
| `--force` | false | Use `git branch -D` (force delete) instead of `-d` |
| `--gone` | false | Target branches whose upstream is gone instead of merged ones |

#### Examples

```bash
# Preview which merged branches would be deleted
gk branch clean --dry-run

# Delete merged branches
gk branch clean

# Clean up branches whose remote was deleted (after PR merges)
gk branch clean --gone

# Force-delete branches (even if not fully merged)
gk branch clean --force
```

#### Notes

- Protected branches (`main`, `master`, `develop` by default) are never deleted.
- Configure the protected list via `branch.protected` in your config file.
- The currently checked-out branch is always skipped.
- `--gone` uses the `%(upstream:track)` field of `git for-each-ref` to identify branches marked `[gone]` — typically the ones whose PR was merged and the remote branch deleted.

---

### gk branch pick

Interactively choose a local branch and check it out.

#### Synopsis

```
gk branch pick [flags]
```

#### Flags

No command-specific flags. All global flags apply.

#### Examples

```bash
# Open interactive branch picker
gk branch pick
```

#### Notes

- Presents a filterable list of local branches using an interactive TUI prompt.
- Falls back to a simple numbered list when running in a non-TTY environment.
- Use `--dry-run` to see which branch would be checked out without switching.

---

## gk switch

Switch to another local branch. When no name is given, opens an interactive picker.

### Synopsis

```
gk switch [branch] [flags]
```

Alias: `gk sw`.

### Flags

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `-c, --create` | false | Create a new branch with the given name before switching (`git switch -c`) |
| `-f, --force` | false | Discard local changes (`git switch --discard-changes`) |
| `--detach` | false | Detach HEAD at the ref instead of switching to a branch |
| `-m, --main` | false | Switch to the detected main/master branch — no branch argument needed |
| `-d, --develop` | false | Switch to the `develop` / `dev` branch — no branch argument needed |

`--main` and `--develop` are mutually exclusive and incompatible with a positional `branch` argument or `--create`.

### Keyword resolution

`--main` resolves in this order:

1. `client.DefaultBranch(remote)` (honors `refs/remotes/<remote>/HEAD`, then looks for `develop`/`main`/`master`)
2. Local `main`
3. Local `master`

`--develop` resolves in this order:

1. Local `develop`
2. Local `dev`

Both exit with an error when no candidate exists in the repo.

### Examples

```bash
# Interactive picker (recent branches first)
gk switch

# Direct switch
gk switch feat/login

# Create and switch in one step
gk switch -c feat/billing

# Jump to the canonical main branch (works for both main- and master-based repos)
gk switch -m

# Jump to develop (falls back to 'dev')
gk switch -d
```

---

## gk reset

Fetch the current branch's upstream and hard-reset the working tree to it. **Destructive.**

### Synopsis

```
gk reset [flags]
```

### Flags

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--to <ref>` | upstream | Override target ref (e.g. `origin/main`); default uses the configured upstream |
| `--to-remote` | false | Reset to `<remote>/<current-branch>` regardless of configured upstream |
| `--remote <name>` | config.remote / `origin` | Remote to fetch from |
| `-y, --yes` | false | Skip confirmation prompt (required for non-TTY automation) |
| `--clean` | false | Also run `git clean -fd` to remove untracked files |
| `--dry-run` | false | Print what would happen without fetching or resetting |

`--to` and `--to-remote` are mutually exclusive.

### Examples

```bash
# Reset to the branch's tracked upstream (prompts for confirmation)
gk reset

# Preview without touching anything
gk reset --dry-run

# Reset to origin/<current> even if no upstream is configured
gk reset --to-remote --yes

# Reset to an explicit ref
gk reset --to origin/main --yes

# Reset and wipe untracked files in one step
gk reset --yes --clean
```

### Notes

- Requires either a TTY confirmation or `--yes`; non-TTY callers without `--yes` fail fast.
- Runs `git fetch <remote> <ref>` before the reset so the target is up to date.
- This command only rewrites HEAD — it does NOT create a backup ref. Use `gk undo` afterwards if you need to recover; reflog still has the pre-reset HEAD.

---

## gk wipe

Discard ALL local changes AND untracked files. **Destructive — stronger than `gk reset`.**

### Synopsis

```
gk wipe [flags]
```

### Flags

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `-y, --yes` | false | Skip confirmation prompt |
| `--dry-run` | false | Print what would happen without wiping |
| `--include-ignored` | false | Also remove ignored files (`git clean -fdx` instead of `-fd`) |

### What it does

1. Writes a backup ref at `refs/gk/wipe-backup/<branch>/<unix>` pointing at the pre-wipe HEAD.
2. Runs `git reset --hard HEAD`.
3. Runs `git clean -fd` (or `-fdx` with `--include-ignored`).

Local commits remain recoverable via the backup ref (`git reset --hard refs/gk/wipe-backup/<branch>/<unix>`). Untracked files are **not** recoverable — they bypass git entirely.

### Examples

```bash
# Preview
gk wipe --dry-run

# Non-interactive wipe
gk wipe --yes

# Also remove .gitignore'd files (e.g. build artefacts in node_modules)
gk wipe --yes --include-ignored
```

### Notes

- Use `gk reset` if you only need to rewind HEAD and keep untracked files.
- The backup ref survives `git gc` as long as it is referenced; delete it with `git update-ref -d refs/gk/wipe-backup/<branch>/<unix>` once you no longer need it.

---

## gk wip

Create a throwaway `--wip-- [skip ci]` commit so you can switch contexts without losing work.

### Synopsis

```
gk wip
```

### What it does

1. `git add -A` — stages every tracked change, including deletions.
2. `git commit --no-verify --no-gpg-sign -m "--wip-- [skip ci]"` — skips hooks and signing for speed.

If the working tree is clean (nothing to commit), it reports `nothing to wip — working tree is clean` and exits 0.

### Examples

```bash
gk wip                # stash-like save without using the stash stack
git switch other-branch
# ... do something else, then come back ...
gk switch -
gk unwip              # restore the working tree
```

---

## gk unwip

Undo a WIP commit created by `gk wip`.

### Synopsis

```
gk unwip
```

### What it does

1. Reads HEAD's subject via `git log -1 --format=%s`.
2. Refuses unless the subject starts with `--wip--`.
3. Runs `git reset HEAD~1` so the committed changes return to the working tree.

### Examples

```bash
gk unwip
```

### Notes

- The refusal is intentional — `unwip` will never rewind a non-wip commit, so it is safe to run on top of a branch where you're not sure what's at HEAD.
- Pairs with `gk wip`; these commands are not intended for stash-like stacking. Use `git stash` if you need a stack.

---

## gk worktree

Worktree management helpers. Wraps `git worktree` with an opinionated JSON output.

### Synopsis

```
gk worktree <subcommand> [flags]
```

Alias: `gk wt`.

### Subcommands

| Subcommand | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `list` | List worktrees (table or `--json`) |
| `add <path> [branch]` | Create a worktree at `<path>` checking out `[branch]` (or HEAD) |
| `remove <path>` | Remove a worktree |
| `prune` | Prune worktree administrative records |

### gk worktree add

Flags:

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `-b, --new` | false | Create a new branch named `[branch]` at `--from` |
| `--from <ref>` | HEAD | Base ref for the new branch |
| `--detach` | false | Detach HEAD in the worktree instead of tracking a branch |

### gk worktree remove

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `-f, --force` | false | Force remove even when the worktree is dirty or locked |

### Examples

```bash
# JSON list for scripts
gk worktree list --json

# Add a worktree that tracks an existing branch
gk worktree add ../gk-feat feat/login

# Create a new branch in a new worktree off HEAD
gk worktree add -b ../gk-review feat/review

# Create a new branch off a specific base
gk worktree add -b ../gk-hotfix hotfix/1.2.3 --from origin/main

# Remove cleanly
gk worktree remove ../gk-feat
```

---

## gk continue

Continue the current rebase, merge, or cherry-pick after resolving conflicts.

### Synopsis

```
gk continue [flags]
```

### Flags

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--yes` | false | Skip confirmation prompt and continue immediately |

### Examples

```bash
# Continue with interactive confirmation
gk continue

# Continue without prompting (useful in scripts)
gk continue --yes
```

### Notes

- Detects the in-progress operation (`rebase`, `merge`, or `cherry-pick`) automatically.
- In a non-TTY environment without `--yes`, gk aborts safely instead of hanging.
- Exits with code 3 if there is a conflict that must be resolved first.

---

## gk abort

Abort the current rebase, merge, or cherry-pick and restore the previous state.

### Synopsis

```
gk abort [flags]
```

### Flags

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--yes` | false | Skip confirmation prompt and abort immediately |

### Examples

```bash
# Abort with interactive confirmation
gk abort

# Abort without prompting
gk abort --yes
```

### Notes

- Detects and aborts `rebase`, `merge`, or `cherry-pick` automatically.
- Restores the working tree and branch to the state before the operation began.

---

## gk config

Read gk configuration.

### Synopsis

```
gk config <subcommand> [flags]
```

### Subcommands

| Subcommand | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `show` | Print the fully resolved configuration as YAML |
| `get <key>` | Print a single config value by dot-notation key |
| `set <key> <value>` | Not yet implemented |

---

### gk config show

Print the resolved configuration, merging all layers.
